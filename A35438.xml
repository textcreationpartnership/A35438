         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We live in an Age (O that we could live it) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>hand of Providence</hi> works <hi>gloriouſly, yea ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly:</hi> Having then, got three or foure ſteps further into this <hi>Book of Providence,</hi> it will not be unſeaſonable, to ſhew you the <hi>Prints</hi> of them. Eſpecially ſeeing this Hiſtory of <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction, looks ſo like a prophecy of ours; and (almoſt in every line) gives us ſome lineament of our preſent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and diſtempers, of our hopes and feares.</p>
            <p>In the three former Chapters we had a <hi>Narrative</hi> of the caſe, and of thoſe occurrences out of which the Queſtion here debated receives it's ſtate. As alſo the bringing together of the <hi>Interlocutors,</hi> or perſons maintaining this Diſcourſe: As we may alwayes obſerve in the writings of the <hi>Ancients,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40455:3"/> whether Naturall, Morall or Divine, which are compoſed into Dialogues or Diſputes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This great Divinity act</hi> (one of the greateſt ſurely and moſt ſolemn, I thinke the firſt that ever was held out, in ſuch a formality, in the world) is principally ſpent, upon that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble probleme, How the juſtice and goodneſſe of God can be ſalved, while his providence diſtributes good to the evill, and evill to the good.</hi> A Queſtion ſtarted and toucht in many books of the holy Scriptures; but is here <hi>(ex profeſſo)</hi> purpoſely handled: Firſt, in a very long Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between <hi>Job the Reſpondent, and his three Friends Opponents;</hi> Then in a full determination, firſt, by <hi>Elihu</hi> an acute and wiſe, then by <hi>God himſelfe, the moſt wiſe and infallible Moderator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Method here obſerved is after the manner of the Schooles <hi>(pro</hi> and <hi>contra)</hi> every one of the foure diſputants, having his ſeverall opinion; and each one his arguments in favour of his own. Which, yet, are not preſented in that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted plainneſs of the Schoolmen, with their down-right <hi>(vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur quod ſic, probatur quodnon) This I affirm, this I prove, this I deny, this diſprove. The pen-men</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> never diſcuſs Queſtions ſo, no, nor any of the <hi>old Philoſophers.</hi> This Covert carriage of their opinions, and cloſe contexture of their arguments, Anſwers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies about them, render the Booke ſomewhat dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure to the Readers meditation. And therefore, it will be a deſigne not unprofitable (if that end offer'd at, may be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) briefly to draw them forth, and ſet them before you in a more open light. And doubleſſe, what they hold, and by what <hi>mediums</hi> they mannage their proofs, may (by the bleſſing of God upon ſerious thoughts and frequent reviews) be made out to a very great plainneſſe.</p>
            <p>Towards which, it is obſervable, that, there are many threeds of the ſame colour and ſubſtance, mixt and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven by the Diſputants throughout this whole Diſcourſe.
<pb facs="tcp:40455:3"/> And, that, though the three Opponents with one conſent, ſet up <hi>Job,</hi> as their common <hi>mark</hi> to ſhoot at; yet they take up very different standings, if not different levels, varying each from other in ſome things, as well as all (upon the main) from him.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of the former is this, becauſe there are ſome <hi>common principles,</hi> wherein they all agree: which, if we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, with what is ſpoken in the illuſtration of them, taking in alſo thoſe <hi>concluſions,</hi> which ſprings from them as their <hi>firſt borne:</hi> Then the remainder will ſhew us that proper &amp; distinctive opinion, which each of them holds about this <hi>grand Queſtion of providence;</hi> the events &amp; diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherof, ſeeme ſo croſſ-handed in giving trouble and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to godly men, joy and proſperity to the wicked.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three principles,</hi> wherein <hi>Job</hi> concurs with his three friends; and a fourth, wherin they three concur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The three, wherein all foure agree, are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That, all the afflictions and calamities, which befall man, fall within the eye and certain knowledge of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That, God is the Author and efficient cauſe, the orderer and diſpoſer of all thoſe afflictions and calamities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That, in regard of his moſt holy Majeſty, and unqueſtionable Soveraignty, he neither doth, nor can doe any wrong or injury to any of his creatures, whatſoever affliction he laies, or, how long ſoever he is pleaſed to continue it upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>three principles</hi> and ſuch concluſions, as are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately deducible from them are copiouſly handled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon by them all. In perſuance wherof, they all ſpeak ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glorious things of the <hi>Power, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; Soveraignty of the Lord.</hi> In proclaiming every of which Attributes, the tongue of <hi>Job</hi> like a ſilver Trumpet, lifts up the name of God ſo high, that he ſeems to drown the
<pb facs="tcp:40455:4"/> ſound of the other three, &amp; makes their praiſe, almoſt, ſilent.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends proceed to a <hi>fourth principle;</hi> which, He utterly denies, about which, ſo much of his anſwer, as is contradictory to their objections &amp; rejoynders, wholly conſiſts. That, their fourth principle ſeems to be bottom'd upon two grounds.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That whoſoever is good, and doth good, ſhall receive a preſent good reward, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the good he hath done; and, That whoſoever is wicked, and doth wickedly, ſhall be paid with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent puniſhment, according to the meaſure of his demerits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seondly, <hi>That if (at any time) a wicked man flouriſh in outward proſperity yet, his flouriſhing is very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany, and ſuddenly (in this life) turnes to, or ends in viſible judgements. And, That, if (at any time) a godly man be wither'd with adverſity yet, his withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is very ſhort, and ſuddenly (in this life) turnes to, or ends in viſible bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe two grounds or <hi>ſuppoſitions,</hi> They raiſe and build their <hi>fourth principle,</hi> from which, They <hi>three</hi> make continuall batteries upon the innocency of <hi>Job.</hi> We may conceive the poſition in this frame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That, whoſoever is greatly afflicted, and is held long under the preſſure of his affliction, that man is to be numbred with the wicked, though; no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or witneſſe appeare or ſpeak a word againſt him. Hence</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The peculiar opinion of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> riſes thus; <hi>That, all the outward evils, which over-take man in the courſe of this life, are the proſeeds of his own ſin, and ſo from the proceſſe of Gods juſtice.</hi> He gives us this ſence, for his, in expreſſe termes, Chap. 4. 8. <hi>They that plow iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſow wickedneſſe reape the ſame;</hi> which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies parſonally to <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 22. v. 5, 6.) <hi>Is not thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40455:4"/> 
               <hi>great, and thine iniquities infinite, Thou haſt taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and and ſtripped the naked of their cloathing,</hi> &amp;c. The whole ſcope of his ſpeech bends the ſame way; and is, as if he had ſaid, to <hi>Job; Though thy carriage hath been ſo plauſible among us, that we are not able to accuſe thee of ſin, yet theſe judgements accuſe thee, and are ſufficient witneſſes againſt thee; Theſe cry out with a loud voyce, that thou haſt taken a pledge from thy brother for nought,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Though we have not ſeen thee act theſe ſins, yet, in theſe effects we ſee thou haſt acted them; The ſnares which are round about thee tell us, thou haſt laid ſnares for others, &amp; he that runs may read how terrible, how troubleſome thou haſt been to the poore, in the terrours which have ſeaz'd thy ſpirit, and in the troubles which have ſpoyl'd thee of thy riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bildad</hi> the Shuite ſpeaks ſecond; His opinion is not ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, as that of <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> He grants, that afflictions may fall upon a righteous perſon, yet ſo, that if God ſend not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſpeedily, if he reſtore him not quickly to his former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and honour, then (upon the ſecond ground of the fourth princple) ſuch a man may be cenſured, caſt and condemned as unrighteous. That ſuch was <hi>Bildads</hi> judgement, in this caſe, is cleare <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 5, 6. <hi>If thou wert pure and upright, ſurely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteouſneſſe proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, Though thy beginning was ſmall, yet thy latter end ſhall greatly increaſe;</hi> And verſ. 20, 21. <hi>Behold God will not caſt away a perfect man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoycing.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>I connot aſſent to my brother</hi> Eliphaz, <hi>affirming, That every man afflicted, is afflicted, for his wickedneſſe, I (for my part) believe and am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that a godly man may be afflicted for the tryall &amp; exerciſe of his graces,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but, then I am aſſured, that</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40455:5"/> 
               <hi>God never lets him lie in his afflictions, for, as ſoon as he cries and cals, the Lord awakes preſently, makes his habitation proſperous again, and increaſes him more then ever. I grant the Lord may caſt down a perfect man, but, he will not (in this life) caſt him away; no he will ſpeedily fill his mouth with laughing, and his lips with rejoycing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zophar,</hi> the third Opponent differs from the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in this great controverſie, affirming, <hi>That, the reaſon of all thoſe afflictions, which preſſe the children of men, is to be reſolved into the abſolute will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God; that, we are not further to enquire about his wiſdome, juſtice or mercy in diſpencing them, his counſels being unſearchable, and his wayes paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out.</hi> Thus he delivers his mind (Ch. 11. 7, 8.) <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God?

               </gap>s hard thoughts of <hi>Job,</hi> as either of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, numbring him among the wicked, &amp; aſſigning him the reward of an hypocrite (Chap. 10. 29.) <hi>This is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto him by God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe (I conceive) are the <hi>Characteriſticall opinions</hi> of <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, about his caſe. All conſiſtent with thoſe four principles, which they hold in common, all equally clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the cenſure and condemnation of <hi>Job,</hi> though in ſome things diſsenting and falling off from one another.</p>
            <p>But what thinks <hi>Job?</hi> or how doth he acquit or extricate himſelf from theſe difficulties? very well, His ſentence is plainly this.</p>
            <p>That, <hi>The providence of God, diſpences outward</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40455:5"/> 
               <hi>proſperity and affliction ſo indifferently to good and bad, to the righteous &amp; the wicked, that no unerring judgement can poſſibly be made up, of any mans ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eſtate, by the face, &amp; upon the view of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</hi> He declares this, as his opinion, in cleare, reſolute and Categoricall termes, (Ch. 9. v. 22, 23.) <hi>This is one thing, therefore I ſaid it, He deſtroyeth the perfect and the wicked, if the ſcourge ſlay ſuddenly, he will laugh at the triall of the innocent.</hi> Which opinion hath no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell at all with any of thoſe three principles, held by <hi>Job</hi> joyntly, and in conſort, with his three friends, but only with their fourth: which he throughout refutes as <hi>heterodox</hi> &amp; unſound in it ſelf, as uncomfortable to the Spirits, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with experiences of the Saints. In the <hi>Strong hold and Fort-royal</hi> of this holy truth, <hi>Job</hi> ſecures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt all the aſſaults, and ſcatters all the Objections of his Opponents: reſolving to maintain it to the very death; he will lay his bones by this poſition, ſay his unkind friends, what they can against him, &amp; let the moſt wiſe God, doe what he pleaſes with him.</p>
            <p>That, he was a ſinner, he readily grants; that, he was an hypocrite, he flatly denies.</p>
            <p>That, the Lord was righteous in all his dealings with him, he readily grants. That, himſelf was righteous, becauſe the Lord had dealt ſo with him, he ſtatly denies.</p>
            <p>How perfect ſoever he was, he confeſſes, that, he needed the <hi>free-grace</hi> and mercies of the Lord to juſtifie him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, aſſerts, that he was perfect enough, to justifie himſelfe againſt all the challenges of man.</p>
            <p>In theſe acknowledgements of his ſinfullneſſe, and denials of inſincerity. In theſe humblings of himſelf before God, and acquittings of himſelf before men: in theſe implorings of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Lord, and complainings of the unkindneſſe of his brethren, the strength of <hi>Jobs</hi> anſwer conſists, and the ſpecialties of it may be ſumm'd up.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40455:6"/>
            <p>'Tis true that through the extremity of his pain, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his ſpirit, and the provocation of his friends, ſome unwary ſpeeches ſlipt from him. For which, <hi>Elihu</hi> reproved him gravely and ſharply, of which, himſelfe repented ſorrowfully and heartily, all which, the moſt gracious God paſſed by and pardon'd freely, not imputing ſin unto him.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>(Chriſtian reader)</hi> I have endeavoured (as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the whole Book, ſo now) to give a brief account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Argumentative part of it: And to repreſent how far in this great <hi>Controverſie,</hi> the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> and his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors</hi> agree in <hi>judgement,</hi> and where they part.</p>

                  <p>The Preface of his ſpeech is contained in the ſecond Verſe, <hi>If we aſſay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Body of his ſpeech is extended through this fourth and to the laſt Verſe of the fifth Chapter: It conſiſteth eſpecially of two members, or two ſorts of matter, in which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> deals with <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is reprehenſory, by way of conviction and reproof.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is exhortatory, by way of counſell and advice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>Eliphaz</hi> reprehends <hi>Job.</hi> This work of reprehenſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the third Verſe of this Chapter, and is continued to the end of the fourth Verſe of the fift Chapter. And to ſhew that he did not reprehend him upon paſſion, he grounds this reprehenſion upon reaſon, and ſtrengthens his reproofe with Arguments. And there are four reaſons or ſpeciall Arguments, which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> takes up to make this reprehenſion convincing, the naming of them will give light to the whole, before we come to particulars.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Argument is contained in the words I have read to the end of the ſixth Verſe. And it is taken from the unſuitableneſſe of his preſent practice, to his former precepts.</p>
                  <p>Or from the inequality of the courſe, he now took under afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the counſell he had given others under affliction.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40455:7"/>
                  <p> His ſecond Argument beginning at the ſeventh Verſe and carried on to the twelfth, is grounded upon a ſuppoſed inequality of Gods preſent dealing with him, in reference to his former dealings with godly men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> thought thus, ſurely <hi>Job</hi> is an Hypocrite, otherwiſe God would have dealt with him, as with an innocent; <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I pray thee, who ever periſhed being innocent;</hi> I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee by all examples, by whatſoever is upon Record, in the Hiſtory of all Ages, that thou art an Hypocrite, a wicked perſon; for ſee, if thou canſt finde an inſtance in any Story, of an innocent perſon periſhing. That is his ſecond Argument.</p>
                  <p>His third Argument is continued from the twelfth Verſe to the end of this fourth Chapter; and that he might make the deeper impreſſion upon <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit, he brings it in with a dreadfull Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: a Viſion from God, at once terrifying and inſtructing him, thus to reaſon downe the pride of man. The Argument it ſelfe is coucht in the ſeventeenth verſe. It is drawn from an evidence of preſumption in all ſuch, as ſhall dare to implead Gods juſtice or plead their own: as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid, ſurely thou art a proud and a wicked perſon, for there was never any godly man upon the face of the Earth, no nor any Angel in Heaven that durſt be ſo bold with God as thou haſt been; <hi>Shall mortall man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be more juſt than God? ſhall a man be more pure than his maker? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he put no truſt in his ſervants, and his Angels he charged with folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His fourth Argument begins at the fifth Chapter and ends with the fourth Verſe; and it is taken from the unlikeneſſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> carriage under his afflictions, to that which any of the Saints in any age of the World did ever ſhew forth under their afflictions. He that caries himſelfe ſo, as none of the Saints ever caried themſelves, gives an evidence againſt his Saintſhip, <hi>Call now to the Saints,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe now living upon the Earth, or ſearch the Records con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all the Saints that ever lived, conſider, and ſee whether thou canſt obſerve or reade any paralell of thy complaints, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable expoſtulotions. So much for the ſumme of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Eliphaz</hi> turnes himſelfe to admonition and exhortation in the following part of that fifth Chapter; and there are two Heads of his admonitory exhortation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he admoniſhes him, to ſeek unto God and to call upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40455:8"/> him, Verſ. 8. <hi>I would ſeek unto God, and unto God, would I commit my cauſe.</hi> I give thee no other counſell then I would take my ſelfe. If I were in thy caſe, I would not ſtand thus complaining and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my day, but this I would doe, <hi>I would ſeek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cauſe.</hi> This admonition is enforced by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Arguments to the ſeventeenth Verſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond head of his exhortation beginneth at the ſeventeenth Verſe, and it is to prevaile with him, patiently to bear, and quietly to accept his affliction, or the puniſhment of his iniquity: in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this he ſhews him many benefits and bleſſings, attending thoſe who graciouſly comply with the correcting hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he Verſe 17.) <hi>happie is the man whom God correcteth, therefore deſpiſe not thou the chaſtning of the Almighty;</hi> he concludeth all from his certain knowledge and infallible experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of what he had ſaid (Verſe 27.) <hi>Loe, this we have ſearched it, ſo it is;</hi> Back'd with a warranty, that if he obey, his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhall quickly teach him this truth; <hi>Heare it, and know thou it for thy good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much concerning the Diviſion or Parts of this firſt Speech or diſpute made by <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in anſwer to the former complaint, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out by <hi>Job</hi> againſt the day of his birth, and the night of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, in the third Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The ſix Verſes (lately read) containe (as I ſaid before) the firſt Argument; we have the Preface in the ſecond Verſe, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it ſelfe in the four following. The point which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> deſires to prove and clear is this; that <hi>Job</hi> was guiltie of hypocriſie, of cloſe hypocriſie at the leaſt, if not of groſſe hypocriſie. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> or reaſon by which he would prove it, is the unſuitableneſſe of his preſent practiſe to his former Doctrine. His actions under ſufferings contradict what himſelfe had taught other ſufferers. And this ſpeaks him guilty, The Argument may be thus formed.</p>
                  <p>That mans religion is but vaine and his profeſſion hypocriticall, who having comforted others in, and taught them patience under affliction, is himſelfe (being afflicted) comfortleſſe and impatient.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Job,</hi> thus it is with thee, thou haſt been a man very forward to comfort others and teach them patience, yet now thou art comfortleſſe and impatient.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thy religion is vaine, and thy profeſſion is hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40455:8"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Is not this thy feare?</hi> Here is a goodly religion indeed, a proper peece of profeſſion: and ſuch is thine, this is all thou art able to make out. Thus you have the Logicall ſtrength or the Argument contained in the words. We ſhall now examine them in the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall ſenſe of every part, as they lye here in order. And firſt for the Preface.</p>
                  <q>If we aſſay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himſelfe from ſpeaking?</q>
                  <p>The words import, as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid thus unto <hi>Job;</hi> we thy friends have all this while ſtood ſilent, we have given thee full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and ſcope to ſpeak out all that was in thine heart, let it not grieve thee, if we now take liberty to ſpeak our ſelves: and indeed a neceſſity lies upon us to ſpeak. Two things <hi>Eliphaz</hi> puts into this Preface, whereby he labours to prepare the minde of <hi>Job,</hi> readily to hear and receive what he had to ſay unto him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he tels him that he ſpeaks out of good will and as a friend to him. <hi>If we aſſay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved?</hi> Pray doe not take it ill, we meane you no harme, we would but give you faithfull counſell, we ſpeak from our hearts, not from our ſpleen, we ſpeak from love to thee, let it not be thy griefe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ſhewes that he was neceſſitated to ſpeak, as love provokes, ſo neceſſity conſtrains, <hi>who can withhold himſelfe from ſpeaking?</hi> either of theſe conſiderations is enough to unlock both eare and heart to take in wholeſome counſell. What eare, what heart will not the golden key of love, or the iron key of neceſſity open to inſtruction? when a friend ſpeaks, and he ſpeaks as bound, when kindneſſe and dutie mix in conference, how powerfull!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If we aſſay,</hi> or try. The word ſignifies properly to tempt, either <note place="margin">

                  <p>We may obſerve from this Preamble, <hi>That it is wiſdome to ſweeten reproofe with friendly inſinuations.</hi> Reproofe is a bitter Pill; it is a wholeſome yet a bitter Pill, and there is need to wrap it up in Gold and Sugar, that pleaſing both eye and palat it may be taken downe the better.

By fals into ſinne, the ſoule breaks or diſjoynts a bone, he that will ſet ſuch a minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt handle it gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We may obſerve the holy skill of ſome of the Saints in prayer, preparing God for receiving of Petitions, by prefaces and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſinuations (as it were) getting within him. Thus did <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 18. when he prayed for <hi>Sodome, Let not my Lord be angry if I who am but duſt and aſhes ſpeake unto thee.</hi> There is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40455:9"/> ſuch a ſpirituall art in winding a reproofe into the boſome and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man, <hi>Let it not trouble thee that I thus ſpeak, take my words in good part, If we aſſay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>That it is no eaſie thing to beare reproofe.</hi> To take a reproofe well is as high a point of ſpirituall wiſdome, as to give it well. When we reprove the ſinne, we ſhould love the man; but there are few men who can love their reprovers. You know what is ſaid in the Prophet, <hi>They hate him that reproveth in the gate.</hi> Reproofs are uſually entertained with hatred, and ill taken by evill perſons; reproofe is not alwayes taken in good part, by thoſe who are good. It is but need to have ſome way made for its due entertainment, by the beſt temper'd ſpirits. <hi>Wilt thou be grieved?</hi> it may be weariſome and troubleſome unto thee, but I pray let it not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, obſerve from the Preface, <hi>That in ſome caſes it is our duty to ſpeak and reprove whether men are troubled or no.</hi> How ſhould I be pleaſed if thou wouldeſt receive my ſpeech in good part? but I cannot withhold my ſelfe from ſpeaking, though thou art diſpleaſed; take it how you will, I muſt ſpeak, theſe reproofs muſt out. When we ſee plainly that God is diſhonoured, and that the ſoule of our brother is greatly endangered, we muſt then ſpeak (as God chargeth the Prophet) <hi>whether they will heare or whether they will forbeare.</hi> In ſuch caſes we muſt adventure to <hi>ſave men by</hi>

                     <hi>feare, plucking them out of the fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, obſerve, That <hi>when the heart is full it is a very hard thing, not to give it vent at the lips by ſpeaking.</hi> When the heart is full of matter, the tongue will be full of words; the tongue muſt bring forth the treaſures that are laid up in the heart: <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz) can withhold himſelfe from ſpeaking?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> Chap. 20. 9. thought to ſtifle the meſſage of God in his heart, <hi>I ſaid I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his name,</hi> he began to take up a reſolution to withhold himſelfe from ſpeaking, <hi>but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his word was in mine heart as a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay,</hi> I could not hold it any longer. So the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak that which we have heard and ſeen,</hi> it is impoſſible for us, <hi>the Lord hath ſpoken who can but propheſie?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Amos 3. 8.</note> that is, who can withhold himſelfe from propheſying when once the Lord bids him ſpeak. Words are the conceptions of our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40455:10"/> mindes, and when our thoughts are form'd and organized as it were, and grown to perfection, when thoſe children come to the birth a little ſtrength will bring them forth. Or rather, great ſtrength cannot keepe them, from being brought forth. It is as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for her that is with childe to withhold the birth, as it is for thoſe that have pregnant conceptions or an errand from God, to withhold themſelves from ſpeaking. When <hi>David</hi> kept ſilence (it is a ſtrange connexion) he roared, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3. When he held his peace from good, his ſorrow was ſtirred, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 2. Pangs took hold on him as upon a woman in travell, which made him roare. His heart waxt hot &amp; the fire burned, till he ſpake with his tongue. He was then delivered. Our Engliſh phraſe of <hi>Delivering a mans minde,</hi> may hit this ſenſe well. <hi>Their hearts are barren, whoſe mouths are alwayes ſhut. Who can withhold himſelfe from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>

                  <p>But what is it that he could not forbeare? He could not forbear to tell him, that (as he ſuppoſed) he acted againſt his own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>Behold thou haſt inſtructed many, and thou haſt ſtrengthened the weak hands, &amp;c.</hi>

Hence, when <hi>Goliah</hi> the Giant challenged and defied the Hoaſt of Iſrael, it is ſaid, that all the men of Iſrael when they ſaw the man, fled from him, or fled from his face (he overcame them with his looks) and were fore afraid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 24.</p>
                  <p>This weakneſſe of hands (as we finde inſtanc'd in Scripture) ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes four wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from ſloth and idleneſſe (as we noted before) ſome have ſtrong heads, but they have weak hands, they are ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, but they cannot act, or they are unactive, and an unactive man is a weak-handed man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, weakneſſe of the hands cometh from fear, and ſo that phraſe, <hi>to ſtrengthen the hands,</hi> notes incouraging of a perſon, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 9, 13. <hi>Fear not, let thy hands be ſtrong;</hi> that is, let not fear weaken thy hands: and <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 4. the Princes came to the King and begg'd of him that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> might be put to death; and they give the reaſon from this, <hi>For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>he weakneth the hands of the men of war that remaine in the City, and the hands of all the people;</hi> that is, he diſcourages them, makes them believe they ſhall never be able to ſtand out againſt the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but that he ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly take the City; this is called weakning of their hands: So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 3. <hi>Strengthen ye the weak hands and confirme the feeble knees, ſay to them that are of a fearfull heart, be ſtrong, fear not.</hi> So yee ſee, weaknes of the hands is cauſed by fear; when the bands of the heart are diſſolved (as it were) and looſned by fear, the hand muſt needs be diſſolved and looſned from labour; the hand is not able to work at all, when fear works much upon the heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, weakneſſe of the hands ariſeth from irreſolution, when a man is not reſolved what to do, not ſetled upon a buſines, then his hands are weak. Hence it was the counſell of <hi>Achitophel</hi> to <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40455:11"/> that he ſhould go up upon the houſe top, in the ſight of all Iſrael, and abuſe his fathers Concubines; and he giveth the reaſon of it, <hi>then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall the hands of all that are with thee be</hi>

                     <hi>ſtrong;</hi> his meaning is, then they will be ſo reſolved to ſtick to thee, that they will doe their utmoſt; he grounds his counſell upon the preſent irreſolution of the people, he doubted whether <hi>Abſaloms</hi> party would adhere cordially to him or no, therefore (ſaith he) doe an act which may render thy ſelfe and all that are with thee irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable to the King; this will unite them to thee, and their hands will be ſtrong. If once they be out of hope to be receiv'd into the Kings favour, thou maiſt be out of feare, that they will returne to the Kings obedience. In any lawfull and good deſigne it is beſt to raiſe up reſolution and ingage it to the higheſt. <hi>Where the heart is ſtrongly reſolved, the hands will act ſtrongly.</hi> The reaſon why men are ſlow and dull in great undertakings, is, becauſe they are off and on, full of neutrality and indifferency, in what they undertake. Unſetled ſpirits can never ſettle actions. <hi>A double minded man is</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. There is a falling into affliction, a falling into trouble: So <hi>Prov:</hi> 24. 16. <hi>The juſt man falleth ſeven times a day;</hi> that is, he meets affliction at every turn, he fals into trouble almoſt at every ſtep. Seven times a day, is very often in the day, or often every day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a falling under trouble. And of perſons falling ſo, we are chiefly to underſtand this Text. Many fall into trouble, who yet (through the ſtrength of Chriſt) ſtand firmely under trouble. Others no ſooner fall in, but they fall under it. The ſhoulders of ſome are not able to beare a light affliction, and the afflictions of others are ſo heavie, that no ſhoulders are able to beare them; the back breaks, the ſpirit ſinkes under the load.</p>
                  <p>To ſuch as theſe <hi>Job</hi> lent his hand, his ſhoulders: his counſell was as a ſtaffe in their hands, as ligaments to their loynes and knees. <hi>Job</hi> was well skill'd in ſetting props and buttreſſes of holy advice, to ſuch tottering ſoules. <hi>Thou haſt upheld him that was falling.</hi> We may take the words in all, or either of theſe three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, yet moſt properly of the latter.</p>

                     </note> and praying for one, or in ſaluting, we uſe to bow the knee. And here, what we tranſlate <hi>the feeble knees,</hi> is word for word <hi>the bowing knees;</hi> becauſe when knees bow and buckle or double un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40455:12"/> us, it proceeds from weakneſſe and feebleneſſe: hence the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knee is called the feeble knee. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 5. it is ſaid of <hi>Belſhazzar, his knees ſmote one againſt the other;</hi> he fainted, his ſpirits ſanke within him, then his knees (as a Symptome of his feare) beat one againſt another. The hanging down of hands, notes a kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire in regard of preſent evils: and feeble quaking knees, ſeeme to referre to ſome expected evill. Taking the words with that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>Jobs</hi> work of love appears more full; he not only upheld in preſent troubles, but labour'd to ſtrengthen againſt ſuch as were to come. <hi>Thou haſt inſtructed many,</hi> and inſtructed them many, even all theſe wayes. We may note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That to teach, inſtruct, and comfort others, is not onely a mans duty but his praiſe,</hi> for here <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks it in a way of commendation, though with an intent to ground a reproofe upon it. <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe ſpeaks of what he had done in that kinde, as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own innocence, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. &amp;c. <hi>

                     <hi>of God unto others.</hi> They who know God themſelves, are deſirous that others ſhould know God too. <hi>David (Pſal</hi> 51. 13.) promiſeth and profeſſeth, that he would communicate his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Gods love, in pardoning his ſinne, when he had taſted the ſweetneſſe of a pardon. <hi>Then will I teach tranſgreſſors thy wayes, and ſinners ſhall be converted unto thee:</hi> when my heart hath learned more of God, others ſhall learne more of God from my mouth. This is ſpirituall charity, and it is the moſt excellent and nobleſt charity of all. Charity to the ſoule is the ſoule of charity,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40455:13"/> charity to the better part, is the beſt charity. In this ſence alſo <hi>Job was eyes to the blinde, and feet to the lame,</hi> by guiding them to ſee, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 29. 15.</note> and by directing their feet to walk, in the wayes of God. To give knowledge is better then to give Gold. Inſtruction is the higheſt almes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if we conſider <hi>Job</hi> (of whom all this is affirmed) as he was a great rich man, we may note thus much; <hi>That honourable and great men, looſe nothing of their honour and greatneſſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to the inſtruction of others, though their inferiours.</hi> Some think it belongs onely unto Miniſters to inſtruct; What we inſtruct?

And we finde before this, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſo ſucceſſefull in teaching, that he had an Army of ſcholers in his houſe. The Text ſaith, when he prepar'd for that expedition to reſcue his Nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> that he armed three hundred and eighteen <note place="margin">

The word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, to train in the Principles of Religion, as well as in the poſtures of war: being the ſame uſed in the Book of Proverbs, for teaching a childe the firſt elements of holy knowledge. And that place of Geneſis may very well comprehend both.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly obſerve, <hi>That charity, eſpecially ſpirituall charity, is very liberall and open-hearted. Job</hi> inſtructed not onely his owne, but he inſtructed others, he inſtructed many; he did not confine his doctrine and his advice to his own walls, but the ſound thereof went whereſoever he went; he inſtructed many. And if <hi>Job</hi> who had no ſpecial, no direct calling to it, were a teacher of many: what ſhall we think of thoſe, whoſe calling and buſineſſe it is to teach, and yet teach not any at all? their trade, their profeſſion is to teach, yet they are ſo far from teaching many, that they teach none, and which is worſe, they hinder teaching: they ſtop the mouth of the teacher, and (if they can) the eare of the learner, <hi>they take away the key of knowledge.</hi> They neither open the doore themſelves, nor ſuffer thoſe that would. This is the very ſpirit of wickedneſs. And bleſſed be God, whoſe mighty power hath ſo graciouſly caſt out and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40455:13"/> diſpoſſeſt ſo many places of the Kingdome of theſe wicked ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Further, taking thoſe other parts of his inſtruction, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect perſons afflicted, who are here deſcribed <hi>by weak hands, and feeble knees, ready to fall, unable to ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve firſt, <hi>That ſore afflictions doe exceedingly indiſpoſe for duty.</hi> Sore afflictions make weak hands and feeble knees: the weake hand and the feeble knee are (as I ſaid before) em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of one unfit for any buſineſſe; unfit to work, unfit to walk, when the hand is weak and the knee is feeble, what is a man fit for? Great ſufferings unfit us for action. Hence it is that the Lord mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates the afflictions of his people, ſweetens the bitterneſſe, and takes off the oppreſſing weight of them. God promiſeth to <hi>come</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>with reviving, and that he will not contend for ever with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Why? A principle Reaſon is, <hi>Leſt their ſpirits ſhould fail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and the ſoules which I have made.</hi> Leſt the ſpirits ſhould faile; that is, leſt they ſhould faile in their duties: the ſpirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile in the eſſence of it, the ſpirit is of an eternall conſtitution; but it faileth in the duty often. And if afflictions lie too hard and too long upon a people, their ſpirits fail, their faith fails, their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage failes, their labours cannot be laborious, to carry on and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out their work. Therefore when <hi>Job</hi> ſaw any under afflictions, he endeavour'd to put courage into their hearts, and ſo ſtrength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the generall we may note further, <hi>That the words of the wiſe have a mighty power, ſtrength, and prevalence in them.</hi> You ſee how efficatious the words of <hi>Job</hi> were; <hi>Jobs</hi> inſtructions were ſtrengthuings, thou haſt ſtrengthned the weak hands and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knees; his words were as ſtays to hold them up, that were ready to fall: <hi>Eliphaz</hi> doth not only ſay, thou didſt inſtruct many, &amp; in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing thou didſt intend, it was thy deſign and aime to ſtrengthen the weak hands, but he ſpeaks of what <hi>Job</hi> had effected &amp; wrought; thy words put ſinews into the hands and knees of men that were weak and ready to fall, thy words were as props to hold and bear up the ſpirits of thoſe that were ſinking. Words wiſely diſpenſed and followed, with the bleſſing of God, what can they not doe? God doth the greateſt things in the World by a word ſpeaking? as at the firſt he made the world it ſelfe by a word ſpeaking; ſo he hath done the greateſt things, and wrought the greateſt changes in the World, by a word ſpeaking. When a word goes forth cloathed with the authority and power of God, it works wonders. How
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40455:14"/> hath it raiſed up ſinking ſpirits? how hath it made the fearfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, and the weak-hearted couragious? God by his word in the mouth of a weak man overthrows the ſtrong holds of ſinne, and by a word brings every thought of man, into ſubjection to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4. 5</note> Chriſt. By a word he ſtops the mouth of blaſphemy, and evill ſpeaking; by a word ſpeaking, he makes a man deny himſelfe; by a word he opens the eyes of the blinde, and makes the lame to run and leap like a Hart, in the way of holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>And I could wiſh that the word which I now ſpeak, might (through the bleſſing of God) have ſuch an effect upon your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. O that it might ſtrengthen all weak hands and feeble knees, O that it might uphold all who are ready to fall; we are caſt upon knee-feebling, hand-weakning, yea, heart-weakning times: the ſight of thoſe things which our eyes do ſee, and the hearing of thoſe things which our ears do heare, cauſe many to fear, and the ſpirits of ſome to fall. Now a word inveſted with commiſſion from God, to go and comfort, will maſter all our ſorrowes, and diſpell all theſe fears. If the Lord breathe upon a word, that word will breathe lively activity into a very carkaſſe. Look to thoſe many and gracious promiſes, made to thoſe that mourne, and comfort will flow in. Promiſes are the treaſures of comfort: promiſes hold the Churches ſtock, they are the patrimony of beleivers; it is their priviledge and their honour, to be called <hi>heirs of the promiſe.</hi> While <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17.</note> Chriſt and the Promiſe lives, how can Faith dye, or languiſh, eying a promiſe.</p>

                     </note> it. It ſignifies a vehement amazed trouble; as in that place (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 21.) where when the woman, the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> had raiſed up <hi>Samuel</hi> (in appearance) as <hi>Saul</hi> deſired, the Text ſaith, that when all was ended, ſhe came unto <hi>Saul, and ſhe ſaw, he was ſore troubled:</hi> think what trouble might fall upon a man in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as <hi>Saul</hi> was in, after this acquaintance with the viſions of Hel, think what a deep aſtoniſhment of ſpirit ſeaz'd upon him, ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of minde this word layes upon <hi>Job, Now it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve hence firſt, <hi>To commend a man with a</hi> But, <hi>is a wound inſtead of a commendation.</hi> Thou haſt inſtructed many, <hi>But, &amp;c.</hi> How many are there who ſalute their friends very faire to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or ſpeak them very faire behinde their backs, yet ſuddenly (as <hi>Joab</hi> to <hi>Amaſa)</hi> draw out this ſecret Dagger, and ſtab their honour and honeſty to the heart. As it is ſaid of <hi>Naaman,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 1. He was an honourable man, and a mightie man of valour, <hi>but he was a Leper.</hi> So, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve ſecondly, <hi>Great afflictions may diſturbe the very ſeat of reaſon, and leave a Saint in ſome acts, below a man.</hi> Some acts of holineſſe repreſent the Saints as mad-men to carnall men. So <hi>Paul</hi> appeared to <hi>Feſtus,</hi> and ſo to many of his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Ep: cap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>For whether we be beſides our ſelves it is to God.</hi> Workings of Grace are ſometime ſo farre above reaſon, that they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40455:15"/> ſeem to be without reaſon. So ſome acts of infirmity repreſent the Saints to carnall men, as mad-men. A gracious man works ſo much below reaſon ſometimes, that he ſeems to be without reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, note, <hi>That when we ſee any one doing ill, it is good to minde him of the good which he hath done. Eliphaz</hi> ſaw <hi>Job</hi> fainting, enraged as a mad-man, or as a man aſtoniſhed, he tels him of the wiſe and grave counſell and inſtruction he had given before, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what thou haſt done. As in the <hi>Revelation</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, (Rev:</hi> 2. 5.) <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and do thy firſt works;</hi> vvhen the Church did ill, then he tels her, what ſhe had formerly <hi>done well.</hi> So the Apoſtle, <hi>Ye did runne well, having begun in the Spirit, will ye end in the fleſh:</hi> vvhen he ſaw them runne upon fleſhly ceremonies and ordinances, ye began in the ſpirit (ſaith he) conſider that, and end as ye began. As in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and reaſoning, a falſe concluſion cannot be derived from true premiſes, ſo neither can it in practiſe or in living. Holy premiſes conclude in holineſſe. He never began well, that ends ill.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, obſerve, <hi>That the good we have done is a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to us when we doe the contrary evill.</hi> When a mans latter actions contradict his former, or when his actions contradict his profeſſions, the former good is a ſtaine or blemiſh to him; <hi>It had</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>been better for them not to have knowne the way of righteouſneſſe, then after they have knowne it, to turn from the holy commandement given unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, take this likewiſe, <hi>It is an eaſier matter to inſtruct others in trouble, than to be inſtructed or take inſtruction our ſelves in our own troubles.</hi> Even <hi>Job,</hi> holy <hi>Job</hi> could give thoſe counſels of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and meekneſſe, and quietneſſe under the hand of God, which he could not follow to the full, when it fell upon himſelfe. For though he did not faile to that height, which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> implyeth in this reproofe, yet faile he did. He had ſet others a Copie, which he could not write by or imitate when his own turn came. A good man may quickly give counſell, above his own ſtrength to practiſe.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve laſtly, <hi>It is a ſhame for us to teach others the right way, and to goe in the wrong our ſelves. Eliphaz</hi> ſeekes to ſhame and convince <hi>Job</hi> upon this very ground, thou haſt done thus and thus, thou haſt taught others patience, and thou art mad thy ſelfe: art thou not aſhamed to complain and cry out of thy afflictions, when thou haſt bid others be quiet and cheerfull under them? It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing when our words are made viſible, by our actions: as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40455:15"/> he ſaid in the Church ſtory, <hi>The faith which is ſeene, is a great deale better, than the faith which is heard;</hi> ſo we may ſay in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde, the wiſdome which is ſeen in bearing of affliction, is far better than the wiſdome which is heard. <hi>Phyſitian heal thy ſelfe. He ſaved others, himſelfe he cannot ſave,</hi> ſay the Jewes to Chriſt. Man may juſtly be reproved with, thou teacheſt others, thy ſelfe <note place="margin">Turpe eſt docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem cum culpa redarguit ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</note> thou canſt not teach. When the ſame fault which we reprehend in others, may be reprehended in our ſelves, our fault is doubled, and the act not only ſinfull, but ſhamefull. The Apoſtle convinces the Jewes mightily by this Argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Thou art confident that thou thy ſelfe art a guide of the blinde, a light of them which are in darkneſſe, an inſtructer of the fooliſh, &amp;c.</hi> Thou takeſt upon thee all this, <hi>Thou therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? thou that preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteale, doſt thou ſteale?</hi> He goes on, preſſing it upon them, as matter of ſhame and bluſhing that their actions ranne ſo croſſe and contradictory to their own profeſſions.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have opened the minor propoſition or aſſumption of the firſt Argument, couched in theſe two Verſes; thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, inſtructed, and taught many, yet when trouble commeth upon thee, thou knoweſt not how to order thy ſelfe. <hi>Is not this thy feare, thy confidence, the uprightneſſe of thy wayes, and thy hope?</hi> Thus he gathers the concluſion, and from hence inferres <hi>Job</hi> a hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in Religion, or irreligious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is not this thy feare &amp;c?]</hi> As if he had ſaid, thy feare, thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, thy uprightneſſe, thy hope, thy religion, call it what thou wilt, is but thus much, or is but this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is not this thy feare?]</hi> In the firſt Verſe of the firſt Chapter 'twas ſhewed what the feare of God is; part of <hi>Jobs</hi> character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus given, <hi>A man fearing God.</hi> Now <hi>Eliphaz</hi> by this firſt point of his Interrogatories, taxes <hi>Job,</hi> in the firſt part of his character or commendation, Thou art reported to be a man fearing God, is not this thy feare?</p>
                  <p>Feare is taken either for the whole compaſſe of Gods worſhip, or for that awfulneſſe of affection with which we worſhip God, which we ought to mingle and mix in all our actions and duties. Therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.) <hi>Let us have grace to ſerve him with reverence and godly feare.</hi> And Pſalme the ſecond, <hi>Serve the Lord with feare.</hi> God is to be ſerved in love, and yet God loves no ſervice which hath not this ingredient, Holy feare.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40455:16"/>
                  <p> Feare is the moſt proper affection which we creatures, duſt and aſhes who are at ſuch an infinite diſtance from God, can put forth in his worſhip. God condeſcends ſo farre as to be loved by us, yea he calleth for our love as a friend, or as a father, as a familiar, as one in neer relation: but conſidered in his Majeſty, glory, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, feare is the moſt ſuitable affection in our approaches unto God. The name of God in ſome languages, is derived from feare, and God is expreſly called <hi>Fear</hi> by <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 31. in that diſpute with <hi>Laban,</hi> where he telleth him, <hi>Except the fear of his father Iſaac had been with him, &amp;c.</hi> Verſe 42 <hi>And Jacob ſware by the fear of his father Iſaac,</hi> Verſe 53. that is, by that God whom his father <hi>Iſaac</hi> feared: <hi>Jacob</hi> was a man ſo holy, that he would take nothing into his mouth to ſwear by, but onely the holy Name of God. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſwearing is one of the higheſt acts of worſhipping, as vaine ſwearing is one of the higheſt acts of prophaning the name of God.</p>

                  <p> But the word is often taken in a contrary ſenſe, as we tranſlate, for conſtancy or confidence, and ſometimes for hope; and thus <hi>Job</hi> 31. 24. <hi>If I have ſaid to gold, thou art my hope, or my confidence;</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 14. ſpeaking of the Hypocrite, <hi>whoſe hope ſhall be cut off,</hi> the ſame word is uſed; and <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>The Lord ſhall be thy confidence, and he ſhall keep thy foot from being taken;</hi> and (not to heape many places) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 7. <hi>That they may ſet their hope in God.</hi> In this ſenſe it is generally underſtood here, <hi>Is not this thy fear and thy confidence,</hi> ſc. <hi>all the truſt thou haſt placed in thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Feare and confidence are acts of naturall worſhip. Confidence or Truſt is the reſting of the ſoule upon another, here the reſting of the ſoule upon the Word, or promiſes of God, upon the power, faithfulneſſe, and truth of God: an act thus put forth by the ſoule, is confidence. Now ſaith <hi>Eliphaz, is not this thy confidence?</hi> thou haſt ſpoken much of reſting and truſting upon God and his Word, upon his power and faithfulneſſe; is not this that which thou haſt all this while talked of? See what a goodly confidence it is! Doth it look like a proper piece of grace?</p>
                  <p>Confidence is an act beyond faith; a ſoule confiding walkes in a higher Region of grace and comfort than a ſoule only believing; there may be believing, where there is not this confiding. As pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is hope lengthned, ſo confidence is hope ſtrengthned. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the higheſt degree of faith, and confidence is the higheſt degree of aſſurance. It carries with it, firſt cheerfulneſſe oppoſite to ſorrow; ſecondly courage, oppoſite to fear and deſpondency of ſpirit; thirdly, boldneſſe &amp; adventurouſneſſe oppoſite to cowardice. Confidence having a good cauſe and a good call, will take a Beare by the tooth, or a Lion by the beard. Fourthly, it notes boaſting, or a kinde of ſpirituall wiſe bragging, oppoſite to ſinfull modeſty or concealement of what God hath done for us. Or take it thus. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is the nobleſt exerciſe of faith, which looking ſteadily upon God in himſelfe, and in Chriſt, through the promiſes, raiſes the ſoule above all fears and diſcouragements, above all doubts and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietments, either about the removing of evill, or the obtaining of good.</p>
                  <p>Hence confidence is well called the reſt of the ſoule, therefore ſuch as attaine to confidence are ſaid to be in peace, <hi>in perfect peace.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſay 26. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Him wilt thou eſtabliſh in perfect peace, whoſe heart doth truſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.</hi> And this act of confidence or truſt is proper and peculiar
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40455:17"/> to God, no creature muſt ſhare in it. This is worſhip commanded in the firſt precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before mee.</hi> Whatſoever we confide in unleſſe it be in ſubordination unto God, we make it our God. And it is one of the higheſt acts of the ſoule, not onely as we reſpect the taking in, our own comforts, but alſo the giving out, glory unto God. This confidence is well coupled with holy feare, the more we feare God ſo, the more we truſt him; ſuch feare is the mother and nurſe of confidence: But confidence is directly contrary, yea contradictory to carnall feare; he that truſts God indeed, leaves both ſoule and body, temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eſtate with him, without ever ſending a fearefull thought, or a jealous looke after either.

                     <hi>where is?</hi> ſo the vulgar and divers others, reading it thus, <hi>Where is thy feare and thy confidence, thy patience and the perfection of thy wayes?</hi> As if he had ſaid, what's become of all thoſe graces, of which thou haſt ſpoken, and with which thou haſt been reported to be moſt richly endowed? where are they at this time? in this day of thy trouble, in this day of thy tryall? Taking the words in that ſenſe, they yeeld us theſe Obſervations. Firſt,</p>
                  <p>That <hi>times of trouble are ſpeciall times for the uſe of our graces.</hi> It is as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid, Thou thy ſelfe and all that knew thee have ſpoken much of thy grace, but now is the time to uſe it, where is it? ſhew it me now, <hi>where is thy feare and thy confidence?</hi> if a man have been reported very skilfull at his weapon, when he comes into danger, then is the time to ſhew his skill: and we may ſay to him, where is thy skill now? where is thy art now? ſo we ſay to a man that hath had ſtore of Weapons and Armes in his houſe, when the enemy approaches, where is your Sword now? where's your Gun? where's your Artillerie? So here, Now, that thou haſt moſt need of thy graces, where are they? bring them forth, are they to ſeek now? Is thy righteouſneſſe as the morning dew, and as a cloud vaniſhed away? Times of trouble will put every grace to a ſtreſſe; and we had need looke to it, that we have not our graces to ſeek, when we have moſt need to uſe them; that when it ſhall be ſaid unto us, where is your faith? where's your
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40455:18"/> hope? we may be able to hold them forth, and anſwer the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in our actions, here they are, here is my feare, here is my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, here is my hope, here is my uprightneſſe; I can make proofe of them, and render them viſible in my life: I can (through the ſtrength of Chriſt) act them, and walke according to the rule of every one of theſe graces.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the ground of this argument, which is, that true grace holds out and perſeveres unto the end: For hereby (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz)</hi> I will convince thee for an hypocrite, and that thy grace is but a ſhadow of grace, becauſe it is decayed and gone. This being the ground of conviction by theſe words, <hi>where is thy feare?</hi> Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That falſe grace, or a ſhew of grace, failes us when we have moſt need of it.</hi> A hypocrite ſeemes to ſtand in grace, till he falls into trouble. When good is in ſight, he ſuppoſes he hath a great ſtock of faith; He is joyfull in beleiving any thing, when nothing pinehes him: And when he enjoyeth what he deſired, he hopes as much as is promiſed: But when outward comforts are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn and ecclipſed, when he muſt live upon a word, and releive himſelfe upon inviſibles, when he hath nothing in the creature to ſupport him, and muſt truſt what he cannot ſee: then this phancie of faith, this vaine hope, and pretended confidence diſappeare, and where are they? how much charitie will ſome make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of untlll a reall object of charitie preſent it ſelfe? then excuſes are made, they have but little for themſelves, times are hard they may be ſuddenly caſt into ſtreights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they know not what a day may bring forth. Falſe charity, and falſe hope vaniſh when they ſhould act their parts, and make good what they have profeſſed. As Chriſt ſpeakes of the two houſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. One built upon the rock, the other upon the ſand: theſe two houſes were alike skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſtrongly built in all appearance; while the Sunne ſhone, and the weather was faire, none could diſcerne, but that the houſe upon the ſand, was built as well, and might have ſtood as long as the other upon the rock; but when the raine fell, and the floods came, when the windes blew and beate upon the houſe, then it fell, the foundation failed, and all the faire ſuperſtructions came downe into the duſt Where is the hypocrite with all his faith and feare in a wet windy day? is he not like a houſe founded on the ſand? Or is not he and his goodly outſide of holy feare and hope like the Apples of <hi>Sodome</hi> (reported in Hiſtorie) which are faire
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40455:18"/> to the eye, but touch them and they crumble to aſhes in your hand, ſo is the faith and the feare, the hope and confidence of hypocrites: Where are theſe? they are no where, for they never were.</p>
                  <p>Take the words in a ſecond conſtruction, and ſo they are thus rendred, <hi>Is not thy feare thy confidence? and the uprightneſſe of thy wayes thy hope?</hi> So M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Broughton, Is not thy Religion thy hope? and thy right wayes thy confidence?</hi> and then the ſenſe is, as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had thus ſpoken unto <hi>Job,</hi> Doth it not now plainely appeare, that Satan charged thee rightly, that thou ſerveſt God for ends of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and outward comforts, ſeeing thou art thus impatient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, when the hand of God takes away thy profit and outward comforts? Is it not a cleare argument, that thou heretofore didſt obey God, only to gaine by him, or becauſe thou waſt confident he would protect and ſave thee harmleſſe, he would bleſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper thee with encreaſe? Was not the uprightneſſe of thy wayes this hope? that is, diddeſt thou not looke to thrive by upright deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with men, and faire carriage in all thy actions? thou hadſt no love to Religion, none to Juſtice, thy love was to thy purſe, thy profit; and thou didſt beleeve, at leaſt hope, that profit would come in at the doore of the Sanctuary, or elſe thou hadſt never gone ſo often thither. This is the ſecond ſenſe, praedicating the firſt terme of the ſecond, <hi>Is not thy feare thy confidence? and is not thy uprightneſſe thy hope?</hi> ſurely 'tis. This is a faire expoſition of the words, and from it we may obſerve. That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A hypocrites profeſſion of Religion is grounded on his confidence to gaine by it.</hi> Is not thy feare thy confidence? thy Religion was nothing elſe but a hope to be rich. It was Satans objection, and now <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (reſuming and managing Satans argument) makes it his conviction. And it is a truth in the generall theſis, that the Religion or the feare of hypocrites, is nothing but their confidence; they conſider the word of promiſe, which God hath given to thoſe that ſerve him; they in their thoughts ſurveigh the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and taſt the milke and honey of it: they reade that God <hi>will give both grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walke uprightly,</hi> therefore that they may be under the influence of theſe promiſes, or upon a confidence that they ſhall receive golden ſhowers out of theſe pretious promiſes, and digge aboundant treaſure out of theſe heavenly <hi>mines,</hi> they <hi>feare and worſhip God,</hi> they are upright in their wayes, and honeſt in their dealings among men: Chriſt found it was love to the loaves, not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40455:19"/> to his doctrine, which brought ſo many after him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. They liked a miracle to feed them, more than a Sermon to inſtruct them: And were affected with the meate which endures to everlaſting life, onely in ſubordination to the meate which periſheth. How many ſay, at leaſt in their hearts, at this day, if I caſt my ſelfe into ſuch and ſuch courſes of holineſſe, ſhall I not have credit and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, good acquaintance and profitable correſpondence? In many men their wickedneſſe is their confidence, that is, the very reaſon why they are ſo wicked, is, becauſe they are confident they ſhall get by their wickedneſſe; So thoſe entiſers ſaid to the young man, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 1. 11.) <hi>Come let us lay waite for blood,</hi>

                     </note> there was their wickedneſſe; now at the twefth verſe, you ſhall finde, that the riſe of their wickedneſſe was this confidence, <hi>we ſhall finde all precious treaſure, we ſhall fill our houſes with ſpoile.</hi> Some (I confeſſe) have ſuch a ſpirit of wickedneſſe, that they are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for wickedneſſe ſake: and they love the very ſinne it ſelfe, more than the ends of profit or pleaſure, which may poſſibly follow the ſinne; but others act the ſinne, out of confidence they ſhalll ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance themſelves by it: And ſo there are many, ſo refined in their aymes and hightned in the wayes of holineſſe, that they are holy for holineſſe ſake, and religious for religions ſake; yet there is a generation, whoſe Religion is nothing but this confidence; I will caſt in my lot with the godly, I will take their way, ſhall I not fill my houſe with treaſure, and raiſe an eſtate by it? The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſuch, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5.) <hi>Men ſuppoſing that gaine is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> and they are godly only that they may gaine by it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they whoſe hearts are perfect with God, love godlineſſe, for Gods ſake; and they are holy, not out of confidence of gaining by it, but out of a delight in acting of it; there is a beauty, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in holineſſe which takes their hearts; And they are above, not only this poore confidence, to be enriched by it; but alſo above that rich, that heavenly confidence, to be ſaved by it, to get Heaven by it. The feare of ſome, who are above the former, is yet but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to this confidence; they ſee there is no other way to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to goe to Heaven but this. Now I ſay, holineſſe in the height and purity of it, keepes under the reſpect of Heaven it ſelfe; it is ſo much above theſe things below, that it is above thoſe things above: That is a ſecond ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The words are underſtood by divers of the Hebrew writers, for a direct and ſimple aſſertion, and they give it thus.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40455:19"/> 
                     <hi>Will not, or would not thy feare be thy confidence? and the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy wayes thy hope?</hi> As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had thus ſaid unto him; <hi>Job</hi> thou haſt pretended much holineſſe and Religion, feare and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe: why art thou ſo diſquieted, now, that the hand of God is upon thee? why art thou ſo amazed under theſe ſufferings? would not that feare be thy confidence? and would not that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of thy wayes be thy hope? ſurely it would, if thou hadſt any ſuch feare as thou pretendeſt: this feare would be thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and this uprightneſſe thy hope; thou wouldeſt be very bold, and by hope caſt Anchor upon the goodneſſe and faithfulneſſe of God, in the middeſt of all this ſtorme: thy heart would be poiſed, ſetled and eſtabliſhed, notwithſtanding all theſe ſhakings. Would not thy feare be thy confidence? It would. Hence obſerve;</p>

                     <hi>to be confident in times of trouble.</hi> They who feare moſt (in one ſenſe) feare leaſt, they who feare God moſt, feare creatures leaſt, and creature-troubles leaſt. We have this point in ſo many words, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 14. 26.) <hi>In the feare of the Lord is ſtrong confidence.</hi> The feare of the Lord is the cure of all other feares. They who are moſt fearefull of the evill of ſinne, are moſt couragious among the evills of ſuffering. To be fearefull thus, raiſeth the higheſt acts of confidence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 7, 8.

When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were much amazed and aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at the giving of the Law, <hi>Moſes</hi> comes to cure them of that feare; but what is the medicine? <hi>Feare not, for God is come to prove you, and that his feare may be before your faces, that ye ſinne not.</hi> As if he had ſaid, when God hath put his feare into your hearts, ſuch feares as theſe will be removed and vaniſh: when your hearts are filled with this feare of God, you will have confidence to heare, and ſee the thunder and lightning of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> you ſhall not feare, no not this terrible tempeſt, in which the Law it ſelfe is given. So when the people were in a feare another time, <hi>Samuel</hi> thus beſpeakes them in that ſhaking fit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 20. <hi>Feare not, onely feare the Lord.</hi> If you will be confident in ſuch a time as this (for by prayer he procured thunder and raine in that time of wheate-harveſt) <hi>feare the Lord.</hi> The feare of the Lord will be our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40455:20"/> confidence in the wetteſt day, in the moſt tempeſtuous and ſtormy night that ever fell upon the ſecure, ſinfull world. <hi>A man fearing God is the onely dread-nought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may obſerve from the other branch, (for the ſenſe is the ſame) <hi>And would not thy uprightneſſe be thy hope? The uprightneſſe of a mans wayes in good times, doth mightily ſtrengthen his hope in evill times.</hi> When a man can looke back, and approve his heart to God, that he hath been upright in peace and plenty, how full of hope will he be in trouble and in wants? It was that which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pleaded before God, in the day of his trouble and tryall, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 3. <hi>I beſeech thee O Lord, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how I have walked before thee in truth and with an upright and perfect heart.</hi> This was it, when he lay upon his ſick-bed, and as he thought, upon his death-bed, that put life into him, and bare up his ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>A fourth interpretatian is taken from our reading: <hi>Is not this thy feare, thy confidence, the uprightneſſe of thy wayes, and thy hope?</hi> So the words containe foure diſtinct affrming Queſtions, <hi>Is not this thy feare? Is not this thy confidence? Is not this the uprightneſſe of thy wayes? and is not this thy hope?</hi> This is thy feare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Job,</hi> without doubt thou haſt ſhewed all thy goodneſſe at once; or, Is not this all that thou art able to make out and ſhew? Is not this all that thou canſt ſay for, all the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thou canſt give of, thy religion and holineſſe? Haſt thou not ſhewed all? Surely thy great boaſt of Religion is nothing but this. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeemes to call <hi>Job</hi> to make a further or cleerer proofe of his grace; <hi>Is not this thy feare?</hi> or if this be not, ſhew me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe: Thou art a man very famous in the world, much talked of, and highly commended, for feare and for confidence, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe and for hope; what haſt thou more to anſwer that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſave thy own credit, with the credit of thy friends, who have been ſo large in their commendations of, and teſtimonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee? Note hence;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Afflictions diſcover that unto us, which before we knew not. Is not this thy feare?</hi> thou diddeſt not know of what <hi>make</hi> or conſtitution thy feare was, untill now: That's <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and it is a truth; That ſome hypocrites know not, that their graces are falſe, till they are brought to ſuch tryals. They carry falſe, counterfeit coine about them, and ſuppoſe it currant money, till they come to the ballance, or a touch-ſtone. Some are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40455:20"/> active hypocrites, who go about, intentionally to deceive and put a faire mask over a filthy face Others are paſſive hypocrites, who are miſerably deceived by the colluſions of Satan, and the baſe treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their own ſpirits. Many a man is brought to ſee (which before he could not, by reaſon of thoſe miſts of hypocriſie) what his feare is, what his faith, by thoſe changes which affliction works in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly thus. <hi>We ought to make our graces viſible in our actions.</hi> Is not this thy feare? Shew me what thy feare is, if this be not, make proofe of it; The Apoſtle bids <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 5. <hi>Make full proofe of his Miniſtery.</hi> It may be ſaid to ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, is not this your Miniſtery, if it be not, make full proofe of it; Or as the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> in a caſe neere this, <hi>James</hi> 2. 14. 18. <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes,</hi> ſo we may ſay, <hi>Shew me thy feare by thy workes.</hi> Is not this it? if it be not, make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare what it is; <hi>The tree is knowne by the fruits; doe men gather grapes of thornes, or figgs of thiſtles?</hi> or, doe men gather crabs from vines, or ſloes from figg-trees? As an evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit, ſo neither doth a good tree bring forth evill fruit. If thou ſayeſt thou art a vine, make proofe of it, by the fruit thou beareſt, or elſe I muſt conclude, thou art but a thorne or a thiſtle. We may queſtion many for this grace, and for the other grace they pretend unto: For their actions have not the leaſt print or impreſſion of ſuch graces upon them; If any one ſhould hold forth much faith and confidence in God, and this man ſhould run or take unlawfull courſes, to helpe himſelfe, might we not ſay, <hi>Is this thy confidence?</hi> Or if one ſpeaking much of confidence in God, for the accompliſhing of a buſineſſe ſhould yet ſit ſtill, and doe nothing himſelfe, might we not ſay, <hi>Is this thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</hi> this is to tempt God, not to truſt in him. Once more if a man ſhould profeſſe much confidence in God, and yet be taken up altogether about the creature, ſwallowed up with creature-thoughts, or ſwallowing in creature-delights, ſeeking to, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging this creature, and that creature, with neglect of God, may we not ſay, <hi>Is this thy confidence?</hi> Hope is an anchor of the ſoule, but thou art driven with every blaſt, in this thy hope? Hope makes <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>is this thy feare?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then againe conſider this, when <hi>Job</hi> carries himſelfe thus in his trouble, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> telleth him, what <hi>is not this thy feare?</hi> thou art
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40455:21"/> ſurely but an hypocrite, for if thy feare were true, it would have preſerved thee from theſe impatient complainings and diſtempers. Hence obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That true feare, holy feare, preſerves the ſoule, and keepes it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Holy feare, is as a golden bridle to the ſoule, when it would runne out to any evill: It is like the bankes to the ſea, which keepes in the raging waves of corruption, when they would overflow all. If thou haddeſt feare indeed thou wouldeſt never thus breake the bounds of patience. <hi>The feare of the Lord is to depart from evill,</hi> that's the definition of it; therefore if thou haddeſt any feare of God indeed, thou wouldeſt never have done this evill, <hi>Curſe thy day.</hi> Prov. 14. 27. <hi>The feare of the Lord is a fountaine of life, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the ſnares of death;</hi> that is, either from ſinne, which is ſpirituall death, or from damnation, which is prepetuall death; the feare of the Lord is a fountaine of life, to depart from both theſe ſnares of death; where this feare is not, we are ready to joyne with every evill, and ſo to fall into the jawes of every death. <hi>Abraham (Gen.</hi> 20. 11.) argues ſo, <hi>The feare of the Lord is not in this place, therefore they will kill me;</hi> when we perceive a bent of ſpirit, to deviſe evill, and a readineſſe of the hand to practiſe it, (we may conclude) the feare of the Lord is not lodged in that heart.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, obſerve, <hi>That truſt, or confidence in God, ſettles the heart in all conditions. Is not this thy confidence?</hi> Thy confidence certainly is but a ſhadow, for if it had been reall, thou haſt been eſtabliſhed and upheld, notwithſtanding all that weight of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that lies upon thee. When there was an unquietneſſe upon the ſoule of <hi>David,</hi> he firſt queſtions his ſoule about it, <hi>Why art thou diſquieted O my ſoule;</hi> and then directs, <hi>truſt in God,</hi> Pſal. 42. 11. So the Prophet promiſeth, <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 26. 3.) <hi>Him wilt thou eſtabliſh in perfect peace, whoſe heart doth truſt upon thee. They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as mount Zion,</hi> Pſal. 125. 1. He that is carried and toſt thus about, with every winde of trouble and guſt of ſorrow, ſhewes he hath not caſt out this anchor of hope, upon the Rock Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But here a queſtion muſt be anſwered, for the cleering of all, and likewiſe for diſcovering the ſtrength or weakneſſe of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> in this particular caſe of <hi>Job. Eliphaz</hi> taxed <hi>Job</hi> with hypocriſie; becauſe his graces did not act, or they did not act like themſelves, like graces; he gave not proofe of them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40455:21"/> at that time. Hence the doubt is, <hi>Doe a mans fallings or declinings from what he was before, or what he did before, argue him inſincere?</hi> Is there ſufficient ſtrength in this Argument for <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to ſay, <hi>Job</hi> thou haſt been a comforter of others, thou haſt profeſt much holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe heretofore, and now thou art come to the triall, thou canſt not make it out thy ſelfe; therefore thou haſt no grace, therefore all thy religion is vaine.</p>
                  <p>For the reſolving of that, I anſwer firſt, that the propoſition is not ſimply true, that every one who faileth or declineth or falleth off from what formerly he was, or held forth, is therefore an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, or that his graces are falſe, and but pretences; there may be many declinings and failings, many breaches and backſlidings, and yet the ſpirit upright. Indeed falling away and quite falling off, are an argument of inſincerity and hypocriſie; for <hi>true grace is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting grace, true holineſſe endures for ever.</hi> Therefore we are here to conſider, whence theſe failings were occaſioned in <hi>Job,</hi> and how a failing may be expreſt, and continue, ſo, as to conclude inſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it was from a ſudden perturbation, not from a ſetled reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. <hi>Job</hi> was not reſolvedly thus impatient and unruly: an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſtorme hurri'd his ſpirit ſo violently, that he was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his own actions; <hi>Job</hi> had not his affections at command, they got the bridle (as it were) on their necks, and away they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him with ſuch force, that he was not able to ſtop or ſtay them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it came from the ſmart and ſenſe of pain in his fleſh, not from the perverſneſſe of his ſpirit. If the taint had been in his ſpirit, then <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had a ground, a certain ground to have argued thus againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jobs</hi> graces were hid and obſcured, they were not loſt or dead; the acts were ſuſpended, the habits were not removed; when the grace which hath been ſhewed, is quite loſt, that grace was nothing but a ſhew of grace, painted feare, and painted confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: but in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe there was only a hiding of his graces, or a vaile caſt over them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We muſt not ſay he fals from grace who falleth into ſin; nor muſt it be concluded that he hath no grace who falls into a great ſinne: It followes not, that grace is falſe, or none, becauſe it doth not work like it ſelfe, or becauſe it doth not ſometimes work at all True grace workes not alwayes uniformly; though it be alwayes the ſame in it ſelfe, yet it is not alwayes the ſame in its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40455:22"/> true grace is alwayes alive, yet it doth not alwayes act, it retains life, when motion is undiſcern'd. Wherefore they who doe not work like themſelves, or do not work at all (for a time) in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wayes, are not to be concluded as having no grace, or nothing but a ſhew of grace.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much be ſpoken concerning this firſt Argument contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in theſe ſix Verſes, the conviction of <hi>Job,</hi> from his failing in the actings of his grace, the putting forth of that fruit which formerly he had born and ſhewed to the world.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe two Verſes and the three following, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> coucheth and confirmeth his ſecond Argument wherein he further beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the innocency of <hi>Job,</hi> and hopes to convince him of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. The Argument is taken from the conſtant experience of Gods dealings in the world, <hi>Remember, I pray thee, who ever periſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent?</hi> We may give it in this forme.</p>
                  <p>Innocent perſons periſh not, righteous men are not cut off.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Job,</hi> thou periſheſt, and thou art cut off. Therefore thou art no innocent or righteous perſon.</p>
                  <p>The major propoſition is plaine in the ſeventh Verſe; for that queſtion, <hi>Who ever periſhed being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</hi> is to be reſolved into this Negation, <hi>No inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon ever periſhed, nor were the righteous ever cut off.</hi> And <hi>Eliphaz</hi> conceiveth this to be ſo clear a truth, that he challengeth <hi>Job</hi> to give one inſtance to the contrary, out of his own experience; he appeals to experience (which is a ſtrong way of arguing) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I pray thee, who ever periſhed being innocent?</hi> ſhew me the man, and withall he profeſſeth, that he could give many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or examples out of his own experience, that wicked men have periſhed and were cut off, this he doth in the eighth Verſe, <hi>Even as I have ſeen, they that plough iniquity, and ſow wickedneſſe, reap the ſame;</hi> which he inlarges in the three following Verſes, <hi>by the</hi>

                     <hi>Memory is the ſoules ſtore-houſe,</hi> there we lay up Obſervations, and from thence fetch them out, as occaſions invite. Hence Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 57. compareth every Scribe which is inſtructed for the kingdome of Heaven <hi>to a houſe-holder which bringeth forth out of his treaſury things both new and old.</hi> This treaſury is the memory, there holy truths and profitable examples are ſtored and reſerved. <hi>Remember I pray thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſendeth <hi>Job</hi> back to former experiences, we may note, <hi>That it is our duty to lay up and record the dealings of God, whether publick or perſonall, whether with the godly or with the wicked.</hi> It is our duty to obſerve what God doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 4. <hi>He hath made his wonderfull works to be remembred;</hi> as if the Pſalmiſt had ſaid, God hath not wrought ſuch great things in the world, whether reſpecting perſons or Nations, that we ſhould write them upon the water, or in the ſand, which the next puffe of winde defaces and blowes out; <hi>but he hath made his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes to be remembred;</hi> hee will have them written in braſſe, with <hi>a pen of Iron,</hi> and with the <hi>point of a Diamond,</hi> that all ages may heare the judgements and loving kindneſſes of the Lord; <hi>he hath made his wonderfull workes to be remembred,</hi> or he hath made them ſo, as that they are moſt worthy to be remembred. <hi>David</hi> was a great obſerver of experiences <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 31. 35.) he telleth us, that he had (as it were) collected notes concerning Gods
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40455:23"/> dealings all his dayes; and it is to the very point in hand, <hi>I have been young and now am old, yet never ſaw I the righteous forſaken;</hi> himſelfe carefully obſerved the dealing of God in this Pſalme: and in the next <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 37, 35, 36.) he gives the like direction to others; thus I have done, doe you take the ſame courſe too, <hi>I have ſeen the wicked in great power, and ſpreading himſelfe like a green Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree;</hi> then he goes on, <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;</hi> I have conſidered the eſtate of wicked men, let all obſerve the eſtate of the godly; <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi> The works of God expound his Word in his works his Word is often made viſible. That's an excellent expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 7. <hi>The works of his hands are verity and judgement; The acts of God are verity,</hi> that is, God acts his own truths? As the works of our hands ought to be the verity and judgements of God, <hi>(every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Chriſtian ſhould be one of Chriſts truths)</hi> ſo it is exactly with God himſelfe, the works of his hands are his owne verity and judgements. When we cannot finde the meaning of God in his Word, we may finde it out in his works: his works are a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an infallible Comment upon his Word.</p>
                  <p>Yet we muſt take this Caution; the dealings of God in the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and outward part of them, appear ſometimes contrary to his Word, contrary unto his promiſe, but they only appear ſo, they are never ſo. When a man reads a promiſe and finds much good ſtor'd up in it for the righteous, and then looks upon the ſtate of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and ſeeth it full of evill; here is a ſeeming contrariety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Word and the Works of God, but it is onely a ſeeming contrariety, as we ſhall ſee ſomewhat further anon. Therefore in that <hi>Pſalme</hi> 111. 2. where he ſaith, <hi>The works of God are verity and judgement,</hi> he addes, <hi>The works of God are ſought out:</hi> if you will have the verity or judgement that is in the works of God, you muſt not only look upon the outſide of them, but you muſt ſeek them out, ſtudie them, ſtudie them as you ſtudie the Scriptures, and then you will finde out the meaning of them, and ſee how exactly they ſquare with every part of the Word. Why doth <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſend <hi>Job</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience? the ground is this; the works of God are like the Word of God; therefore if thou canſt not make it out by experience from his works, thou canſt hardly make it out, as a Poſition from his Word, <hi>that righteous perſons are cut off.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly to periſh ſignifies to dye.

                  <p>Thirdly, by periſhing we may underſtand outward afflictions and troubles falling upon, either godly or wicked: theſe are called a periſhing <hi>(Joſh.</hi> 23. 13.) <hi>Joſhua</hi> tels the people, <hi>If you will not obey and walk according to the Commandements of God, ye ſhall quickly periſh from off this good Land;</hi> that is, ye ſhall be removed by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions from your Land, you ſhall goe into captivity And ſo, <hi>if I periſh, I periſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eſther, Chap.</hi> 4. 17. that is, if I bring

Hence by a <hi>Metonymie</hi> it ſignifies to take away or to cut off, becauſe things that are taken away and cut off, are as things hidden and ſeen no more. Here then is the height of the ſenſe, either to take it, for periſhing in Hell, or for ſuch a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in this life, as is joyned with totall deſolation and deſertion.</p>
                  <p>Then for the termes, <hi>innocent and righteous.</hi> The word we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40455:24"/> tranſlate <hi>innocent,</hi> ſignifieth empty. And it is therefore applyed to an innocent perſon, becauſe innocent perſons are emptied of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and wickedneſſe, their hearts are ſwept and cleanſed, purged and waſhed; there is in ſome ſenſe a <hi>vacuum,</hi> a holy <hi>vacuum</hi> in the hearts of holy perſons: they are freed from that fulneſſe of evill which lyes in their hearts by nature, that filth is caſt out. Every mans heart by nature is brim full, top full of wickedneſſe, as the Apoſtle deſcribes the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>being filled with all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe;</hi> and it is a truth of every mans heart, it is a <hi>Cage full of uncleane Birds, a ſtable full of filthy dung,</hi> he hath in him a throng of ſinfull thoughts, a multitude of prophane gheſts lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him.

Yet here <hi>Eliphaz</hi> bids <hi>Job</hi> enquire about the righteous, where they were cut off. To clear that.</p>
                  <p>By righteous here, we are to underſtand not righteous perſons in a ſtrict and legall ſenſe, but in a Goſpel mollified ſenſe: righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with an allay, righteous by way of interpretation, and not in the ſtrictneſſe of the letter.

There are none righteous in the root or originall, in their firſt ſetting and plantation in the ſoyle of the world; but there are righteous perſons as regenerate, and tranſplanted into the body of Chriſt, as wrought and faſhioned by the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are none righteous, that is, none exactly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40455:25"/> compleatly righteous, but inchoatly, and intentionally, ſo many are righteous and are called righteous in the language of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there are none righteous, that is, none righteous by way of merit or deſert, none are ſo righteous as that they can challenge any thing at Gods hand, of right, the moſt righteous perſon is an unprofitable ſervant; he hath nothing to plead before God but free grace. Nothing to ſhew unto God but Chriſts fulneſſe, and his own emptineſſe, the riches of Chriſt, and his own poverty. Yet there are righteous in Gods acceptance, he accounteth and accepteth them for righteous, and honours them to be called righteous.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we may anſwer it thus, there are none righteous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or from themſelves, none have any righteouſneſſe of their own making: but the Scripture ſhewes us thoſe who have righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and are righaeous in another and from another; we have the righteouſneſſe of juſtification in Chriſt, and the righteouſneſſe of ſanctification from Chriſt: righteouſneſſe is both imputed to, and floweth into the ſoule by vertue of the union which is promiſed in the covenant of grace with Chriſt the righteous, with <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſſe.</hi> In theſe reſpects there are righteous perſons, and of ſuch we may underſtand this enquiry, <hi>where were ever the righteous cut off?</hi> The righteous by regeneration, the righteous by inchoation, the righteous by acception, or the righteous by imputation; where were any ſuch righteous in all the world of whom thou canſt ſay, they have ever periſhed, or have been cut off?</p>
                  <p>Having opened the ſenſe of the ſingle termes, we will look to the ſenſe of the propoſition, and conſider wherein we may cleare the truth of it, <hi>that innocent perſons doe not periſh, or that the righteous are not cut off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take periſhing or cutting off in the firſt ſenſe, namely, for anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation and returning to nothing; and ſo, neither righteous nor unrighteous, guilty nor innocent can periſh; no man ſhall periſh ſo, man is of an everlaſting make.</p>
                  <p>Then take periſhing in the ſecond ſenſe, as periſhing is put for dying and going out of the land of the living, thus all righteous and innocent perſons periſh and are cut off, namely, by the ſword and ſithe of death: we may ſay all, God indeed hath made ſome few exceptions out of the generall rule, but the Statute is plaine, <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to dye; Enoch</hi> was tranſlated,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40455:25"/> and ſo was <hi>Elijah,</hi> and many ſhall be found alive when Chriſt commeth to judgement, who ſhall not die; they ſhall be but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and have a metaphoricall, not a proper death; This makes ſome ſmall abatement from, but doth not croſſe the generall rule, that all muſt die.</p>
                  <p>Take periſhing in the third ſenſe, for ſome temporall outward ſuffering in the world, either from the hand of God immediatly, or mediately from the hand of man. Thus righteous and innocent perſons may periſh too, that is, they may fall under fore and great afflictions: thus <hi>righteous Abel</hi> periſhed, and thus <hi>Jacob was a Syrian ready to periſh,</hi> and thus the godly party among the Jewes, in the time of the captivity periſhed, <hi>thoy periſhed from off the Land,</hi> as it was threatned, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23.) with the reſt of the wicked; of which the two baskets of figgs, one bad, and the other good, were a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous type, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. 3.</p>
                  <p>And in regard of this outward, preſent, temporall periſhing, we finde it often, that the righteous periſh, while the unrighteous flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 12. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) theſe are the ungodly, that proſper in the world;</hi> and at the fourth verſe, <hi>All the day long have I been plagued, and chaſtened every morning.</hi> As ſure, or as ſoone as I riſe, I have a whipping, and my break-faſt is bread of ſorrow, and the water of adverſity; theſe proſper, and I periſh: And the Prophet <hi>(Jer.</hi> 12. 1, 2.) expoſtulates with holy ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion about this flouriſhing eſtate of the wicked, and periſhing eſtate of the godly: <hi>Wherefore doth the way of the wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, &amp;c.</hi> And in the next verſe, <hi>Thou haſt planted them, yea they have taken roote, they grow, yea they bring forth fruit:</hi> What a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is here of the flouriſhing proſperity of wicked men, while the righteous ſeeme to wither? <hi>Thou haſt planted them;</hi> but every tree that is planted, doth not take roote, but theſe take roote,; Every tree that taketh roote, doth not grow up to any ſtrength, but theſe take roote, and they grow: there are trees that grow, yet they bring not forth fruit, but theſe bring forth fruit alſo; <hi>Yea</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they bring forth fruit;</hi> theſe were flouriſhing trees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yet in the meane time, thouſands of righteous perſons periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and by outward troubles.</p>
                  <p>Sometime (we find on the other hand) that the wicked periſh in outward troubles, while the righteous are delivered, and have Arkes provided to ſave them in a common deluge. God makes that difference ſometime, even in this life; he pulled <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:40455:26"/> while <hi>Sodome</hi> periſhed by fire: And righteous <hi>Noah</hi> was ſaved in the Arke, while the world of the ungodly periſhed by water.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, Both the righteous and the wicked, may be wrapped up in the very ſame outward periſhing condition, yet alwayes with a difference; though both alike periſh, yet their periſhing is not alike. As it is with the righteous and wicked in regard of ſinne, ſo of ſufferings: they may both commit the ſame ſinne for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it is a tranſgreſſion of the Law, but a righteous man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinne as the wicked; he ſins not, with ſuch formalities of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he hath not ſuch a heart, ſuch a temper and bent of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as a wicked man hath in ſinning: to ſinne ſo, is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the new nature. Thus alſo it is with the periſhings, afflictions, and troubles which they fall into; God ſometimes ſends the very ſame affliction for the matter, as ſuppoſe poverty, want, impriſonment, captivity, and the like, upon the one, as upon the other: But are the righteous ſmitten, as God ſmites thoſe that ſmite them? Surely no, in meaſure he debateth with them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 7, 8. They ſinne not againſt God with the ſame heart, or at the ſame rate as the wicked doe: and God never ſtrikes them with the ſame heart, or at the ſame rate as he doth the wicked; he cannot doe it, the ſtrength of his love to them, makes this impoſition for him. Therefore, though as the Preacher reſolves the caſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>No man knoweth either love or hatred, by all that is before him:</hi> In the matter of events, love or hatred are not viſible; yet in the manner of events there is much love and hatred viſible: and the ſpirits of ſuch as are under thoſe events, may diſcerne love or hatred, when no eye can: One ſeeth hatred, and another ſeeth love, aboundance of love mixed in his cup of ſorrow. God never gives his own, a cup of pure wrath to drinke; there are alwayes ſome ingredients of comfort and ſweetneſſe put into it. This is the third ſenſe, how righteous ones may, or may not periſh.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>periſhing,</hi> in the fourth ſenſe, as periſhing is an eternall deſtruction; and ſo the propoſition of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is true throughout, ſtrictly true; That no righteous, ever periſhed, or were cut off; an innocent perſon is, in that ſenſe, paſt periſhing; a righteous man is paſt cutting off. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>I doe give unto them eternall life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> Rejoyce in this, ye righteous, ye are beyond periſhing, ye are paſt periſhing, while ye live in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing world.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:40455:26"/>
                  <p> Laſtly, Take it in the fifth ſenſe, and ſo you may have a further truth, which I conceive, is that which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> purpoſely aimeth at; take periſhing, for outward preſent deſtruction, joyned with a totall deſertion; and in that ſenſe the propoſition of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is true alſo; No righteous man, no innocent man ever periſhed, or was ſo cut off with any temporall judgement: The Apoſtle is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect for it, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 9.) <hi>We are in trouble on every ſide,</hi> (we ſee trouble which way ſoever we turne) <hi>but we are not diſtreſſed, we are perplexed</hi> (we are in the bryars as well as ungodly men) <hi>but not in deſpaire,</hi> (we are in hope ſtill, and if there be hope for us, God is for us:) <hi>We are perſecuted, but not forſaken,</hi> (God is neere us, though all the world ſtand aloofe,) <hi>we are caſt downe, but not deſtroyed,</hi> we ſhall up againe. So that while he admits of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in the former ſenſe, reſpecting outward afflictor, yet he denies it conſtantly in this latter ſenſe, ſo as to be cut off quite from the comforts and ſupports of God. That obſervation of <hi>David,</hi> may be thus underſtood, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 37. 25.) <hi>I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not ſeen the righteous forſaken,</hi> (he doth not ſay, in my experience I never ſaw the righteous afflicted, but, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw him left or forſaken in his afflictions) <hi>and I never ſaw his ſeed begging their bread:</hi> he puts in that, becauſe begging of bread, eſpecially in the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in the ſtate of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> was a note of utter dereliction; for though God had told them, that they ſhould have the poore alwayes with them, yet he had given an expreſſe Law, that there ſhould be no beggar among them; therefore, ſaith he, I have not ſeene the righteous ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, that they ſhould be forced to live by begging.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay, that <hi>David</hi> himſelfe begged, he asked bread of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Caſus tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii non reddunt mendicum.</note> and of <hi>Nabal.</hi> I anſwer. It is a good rule, and it reſolves the caſe; Tranſitory caſes, and ſuddaine accidents, make no beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars: we muſt not ſay, <hi>David</hi> was a beggar, or begged his bread, becauſe once he was in a ſtraite, and asked bread of <hi>Abimelech;</hi> and in a ſecond ſtraite, ſent to <hi>Nabal;</hi> In ſuch ſudden caſes, the richeſt man in the world, may be put to aske a peece of bread. A good man may fall into ſuch wants, but good men are rarely, if ever or at all left in them.</p>
                  <p>Now to apply it particularly to the intent of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in this place. We have given three interpretations, in which we have ſhewed, how righteous men may periſh; and two, wherein the righteous cannot poſſibly periſh; in both which, the words here
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40455:27"/> ſpoken by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> are a truth. And concerning the fifth and laſt, I conceive, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is particularly ro be underſtood: For he ſpeakes not here of the eternal eſtate of <hi>Job</hi> (though that be involved) when he concludeth him a wicked man; but he ſpeakes of the dealings of God in temporals: He look't upon <hi>Job</hi> as a loſt man, a man ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forſaken of his God; as a man of a forlorne hope, cut downe, and pluckt up, root and branch; when he ſaw his ſtocke conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his children ſlaine, his body diſeaſed, and his ſpirit ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered. And ſo the minor, or the aſſumption onely is falſe, the propoſition true; Righteous men doe not periſh thus, innocent perſons are not thus cut off; but thou <hi>Job</hi> periſheſt and art cut off: Hold there, that's falſe; <hi>Job</hi> in the ſenſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> intended, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed not, was not cut off; for in the ſequell, God gave him both comfort and deliverance: Love was mingled with the affliction, ſtrength was miniſtred to beare the affliction: and at laſt a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way was made out of the affliction. The bleſſing of God, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to ſpring out againe: though his goodly branches were broken, and his fruit pluckt off, yet his roots were not pluckt up.</p>
                  <p>It will not be unneceſſary, for the clearing of this Scripture, to ſubjoyne a reaſon, why in the Old Teſtament, or under the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, there was ſo much ſtumbling at the afflictions and troubles of the righteous; for it put even a <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and a <hi>Haba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. Jer. 12. 1.</note> hard to it, for an anſwer, when they ſaw ſuch under ſufferings; the reaſon was this, becauſe God in thoſe times, made more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall temporall promiſes to his people, in caſe of obedience, than he hath done in the time of the Goſpel. Reade <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. and other places, where you ſhall finde, how all the promiſes runne upon things, that concerne the outward man; they ſhall be bleſſed in their basket and in their ſtore, they ſhall have this and that, and all outward things aboundantly; and the curſe threatned, was the loſſe and deprivation of thoſe outward bleſſings in caſe of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: For God did winne and carry them on, in that non-age of the Church, by outward and temporall promiſes; hence they were much troubled and offended, when they ſaw righteous men under heavy preſſures and breaking afflictions. Now ſince the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, and the pouring out of thoſe ſpeciall ſpirituall bleſſings upon his people, by the Holy Ghoſt, he doth not feed us ſo much with theſe outward hopes, or enjoyments. Therefore in the Goſpell, we read what hard meate he giveth his people: fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling them plainly, <hi>If any will follow me, let him deny himſelfe,</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:40455:27"/> 
                     <hi>and take up his croſſe:</hi> There is ſcarce ſuch a word in all the old Teſtament as that: he which will follow me, ſhall finde a croſſe, and be ſure of perſecution; They were but children, ſuch words and ſights might terrifie them; therefore they were (as it were) dandled on the knee, and allured by ſenſible comforts, a land flowing with milke and honey, if they did obey; and they heard of rods and ſtripes in caſe of ſtubbornneſſe and diſobedience; <hi>Say to the righteous, it ſhall be well with him, for they ſhall eate the fruite of their doings: Woe to the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 3. 10, 11. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (indeed) <hi>many are the troubles of the righteous,</hi> but (it is not put among the termes of their ſtate or ſervice) It is not ſaid, if ye will be righteous, ye ſhall have trouble. <hi>Moſes</hi> never told them, If any will be my diſciple, let him taka up his croſſe, &amp;c. So then, Gods dealings and diſpenſations being moſt in outward things at that time, they were very apt to ſtumble at the croſſe. And there is greater reaſon why they ſhould ſtumble at a mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, then we at a mountaine of trouble: God having told us, that ſeeing he hath given us ſuch excellent things in Chriſt, ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mercies, and tranſcendent priviledges in the Goſpel, we may well take afflictions and troubles into the bargaine, and never ſhrinke or ſtraine at them, but rather take them well. So much for that verſe, <hi>The righteous are not cut off, neither doe innocent perſons periſh.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And this plowing of iniquity, or plowing of wickedneſſe, takes in both the outward act of ſinne (to plow iniquity, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and practiſe iniquity) and the inward act of ſinne, to plow iniquity, is as much as to deviſe and meditate iniquity. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 29. Deviſe not <hi>(Heb.</hi> plow not) evill againſt thy neighbour. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>A heart that deviſeth,</hi> or ploweth, <hi>wicked ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 4. <hi>The plowing of the wicked is ſinne;</hi> That is, whatſoever they deviſe, or whatſoever they doe, inſide and outſide, the cloath and linings of their garments are all ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe this word denotes, not onely ſpeculative evils, but alſo ſecrecie of practice; or a plot carried and acted ſecretly. Thus (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 9.) it is ſaid, <hi>David knew that Saul ſecretly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed evill againſt him;</hi> The Hebrew is, he knew that <hi>Saul</hi> plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed evill againſt him. So that it may be taken, either for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating of evill, or for a politick cloſe way of effecting any evill or wicked deſigne.</p>
                  <p>And the Scripture elegantly calls the muſing or meditating of ſinne, <hi>plowing,</hi> becauſe a man in meditation, (when he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh any wickedneſſe) turnes up (as it were) all the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in his heart, and all the conveniencies that are in the world, to attaine his end. As a man that meditates upon any holy thing, <hi>upon Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Free-grace,</hi> &amp;c. turnes up all the graces and abilities, that are in his ſpirit, he plowes up his heart, that he may fetch up the ſtrength, and enjoy the ſweetneſſe of them.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:40455:28"/>
                  <p> So then this ploughing noteth two things chiefly; Firſt, the pains and labour which wicked men take in ſinfull courſes, every one that ſinnes doth not plough ſinne, or is not a worker (which is an equivalent phraſe) of iniquity. Secondly, it implyes the black Art and helliſh skill of wicked men in ſinning. To plough is a skill, &amp; ſo is ſome kinde of ſinning (though to ſin in generall, be as naturall as to ſee, and needs as little teaching as the eare to heare (ſome men (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſome tranſlate this Text ſo; the vulgar reades it thus, <hi>They</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Qui operantur iniquitatem.</note> 
                     <hi>who worke iniquity;</hi> all which expreſſions ſet forth and elegantly deſcribe ſuch, who ſinne reſolvedly, induſtriouſly, cunningly, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſuch as have the art (and will ſpare no pains) to do wickedly. Theſe have ſerved an apprentiſhip to their luſts, and are now as Freemen of Hell, yet ſtill Satans Drudges, and active Engineers to plot and execute what God abhorres.</p>
                  <p>Note this further, that ploughing in Scripture referres both to good actions and to bad; there is a plowing for good, the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor is ſo applyed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 27. <hi>Doe not they erre that deviſe evill?</hi> (that plough evill) <hi>but mercy and truth ſhall be to them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe good,</hi> (to them that plough good) the ſame word is uſed in both; and it intimates (as before) both the paines and the skill which a godly man beſtowes and ſhewes about holy things: the great work of repentance is often allegorized by ploughing, <hi>Breake up the follow ground:</hi> and our obedience to the Goſpell, whether in the profeſſion or preaching of it, is called ploughing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 62. <hi>He that putteth his hand to the plough and lookes backe, is not fit for the kingdome of God.</hi> Grace is as active and as accurate as Luſt can be.</p>
                  <p>It followes, <hi>And ſow wickedneſſe, reape the ſame. Eliphaz</hi> goes on with the Metaphor, after plowing comes ſowing, and after ſeed time, reaping time or harveſt. Sowing in Scripture is divers wayes applyed unto the actions of men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a ſowing which is the work of charity, when we diſpenſe and drſtribute to the helpe of the poore, eſpecially to the Saints; ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly;</hi> that is, he that giveth unto the poore ſparingly.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:40455:29"/>
                  <p> Secondly, ſowing is applyed to the preaching of the Goſpel, to the ſcattering of the Word in at the eares, and into the hearts of men, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 5. <hi>A ſower went out to ſow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſowing is applyed unto the buriall of the dead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42. <hi>that which is ſowne in weakneſſe,</hi> the bodies of men are as ſeed in the earth, they ſhall ſpring up againe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſowing is applyed to repenting teares, <hi>they that ſow</hi>

                     <hi>in teares;</hi> that is, they that goe on repenting and mourning, <hi>ſhall reape in joy;</hi> they ſhall have ſheaves of comfort.</p>
                  <p>And fifthly, it is applyed generally unto any action good or bad, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>He that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reape cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and he that ſoweth to the ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. Sowing (as plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) is uſed in regard of doing good and evill, <hi>ſow to your ſelves in righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſaith the Prophet; and here on the other ſide, <hi>They that plough iniquity and ſow wickedneſſe.</hi> Here is the progreſſe of ſinne: ſinne goeth on gradually, there is not onely a ploughing but a ſowing; ſinne is the ſeed, and there is a ſeminall vertue in every ſin, it will ſpring up againe and bring forth an hundred fold more in miſery, to the whole man, fleſh and ſpirit, then ever it gave in delights unto the fleſh.</p>

The ſame ſaith <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> It is true, A man that ſoweth, doth not reape <hi>the ſame,</hi> individually, or numerically; that is, the very ſame particular ſeed; but he reaps the ſame ſpecifically, the ſame in kinde; that's the meaning here, their crop or harveſt ſhall be like their ſeed time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7 <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reape,</hi> the ſame in kinde, not the ſame in number. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 8. <hi>He that ſoweth iniquity ſhall reape vanity.</hi> It is not the ſinne it ſelfe, which is reaped, but the fruit, the product of that ſinne; that, they ſhall reape; the puniſhment of ſin is the fruit of ſin, and it is called <hi>the ſame: Puniſhment is a</hi>

The bitter things procured by wickedneſſe, are called wickedneſſe. As the ſweet fruits of our good workes, are called our works. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours, and their workes follow them:</hi> their workes follow them, how? Not their workes in kinde, the very ſame individuall workes, which they have done here follow them not (for they are tranſient acts and have no ſubſiſtency) but the fruits of thoſe workes, and the bleſſings, which lie in the promiſe for ſuch as doe thoſe workes, theſe fruits, theſe bleſſings follow them: the bleſſings annexed to faith, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and holineſſe, theſe follow them. So now, when it is ſaid of a wicked man, what he ploweth and ſoweth, he reapeth the ſame, it is to be underſtood of the ſame thing in the iſſue and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it, thoſe curſes, thoſe treaſures, that harveſt of wrath, which lie in the threatnings againſt him, theſe are rained downe upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are made the portion of his cup.</p>

The juſtice of God doth neither commute nor compound penalties with wicked men: as it will not wrong or overcharge, ſo neither will it favour or ſpare them in their ſinnes. God ſpared not his Sonne, when he was in the place of ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. much leſſe will he ſpare any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who is not in his Sonne.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40455:30"/> might leave fighting and goe to ſinning, that they might worke wickedneſſe more quietly, and keep cloſe to their trade, the plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of iniquity without diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly obſerve, <hi>That there is an art in wickedneſſe;</hi> it is Plowing, or as the word imports an artificiall working.

As when we ſay ſuch a man is a Clockmaker, it notes art, as well as action. So to ſay ſuch a man is an Abomination-worker, or a Lye-maker, notes him not only induſtrious, but crafty, or (as the Prophet ſpeaks) <hi>wiſe to doe evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, note from theſe metaphors of plowing and ſowing, <hi>That wicked men expect benefit in wayes of ſinne, and look to be gainers, by being evill doers.</hi> They make iniquity their plough; and a mans plough is ſo much his profit, that it is growne into a Proverbe, to call that (whatſoever it is) by which a man makes his living or his profit, <hi>His plough.</hi> And when we ſay, <hi>there are many candles burning and never a plough going.</hi> It is to tax un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftineſſe or careleſſe ſpending, without honeſt care of getting. Every man tils in expectation of a crop; who would put his plough into the ground to receive nothing? The Apoſtle argues from this as a dictate of nature, <hi>(Cor.</hi> 9. 10.) <hi>He that ploweth, ploweth in hope.</hi> And <hi>James</hi> 5. 7. <hi>The husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth,</hi> having beſtowed his labour, he doth not count it labour loſt. It is even ſo with wicked men, when they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they think themſelves thriving, or laying up that in the earth a while which will grow and increaſe to a plentifull harveſt. What ſtrange fancies have many to be rich, to be great, by wayes of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. Thus they plow in hope, but they ſhall never be partakers of their hope: yea, they ſhall be aſhamed of their hope, their ſin will deceive them. And that which will make their poverty moſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome, is their hope of riches, the expectation they had to gain, will make their loſſe, their breaking, and their undoing intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, obſerve from theſe Metaphors, <hi>That every ſinfull act perſiſted in, ſhall have a certaine ſorrowfull reward,</hi> it ſhall aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40455:30"/> be anſwered with judgement, tribulation, and anguiſh. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly it ſhall. Are not plowing and ſeed-time an aſſurance of the harveſt? They that goe forth vainly rejocing, bearing that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous ſeed, ſhall doubtleſſe come againe, and bring their ſheaves of ſorrow with them. That which God promiſed <hi>(Gen.</hi> 8. 22.) in regard of naturall husbandry, he hath threatned in regard of this myſticall husbandry: after the flood he promiſed, that <hi>while the Earth remained, Summer and Winter, Seed-time and Harveſt ſhould not ceaſe.</hi> So it is here, onely with this difference, the Lord uſeth all means to diſſwade and prevent the ſeed-time of ſinne. But when notwithſtanding all thoſe threatnings, men will be ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquity, he hath made an everlaſting Decree (as firme in its kinde, as that about the waters of <hi>Noah)</hi> that Harveſt ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and every ſuch ſoule ſhall both reape and eat, the fruit of his plowings and ſowings.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, obſerve, <hi>That the puniſhment of ſinne may come long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the committing of ſinne;</hi> the one is the ſeed-time, and the other a reaping-time; there is a great diſtance of time between ſowing and reaping. The ſeeds of ſin may lie many yeares under the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. A man may commit a ſinne in his youth, and not finde the harveſt of it, till his old age. How many (as <hi>Job</hi> complains, but in a worſe ſenſe then he) in their old age, are made to poſſeſſe the ſins of their youth, and feele that which they have forgot. <hi>The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman</hi> (in that place before mentioned, <hi>James</hi> 5. 7.) <hi>waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it:</hi> and through the long patience of God, ſome wicked men (though they thought their ſins not ſowed, but buried for ever, and never deſire to ſee or heare of them, yet) in a ſenſe ſome wicked men (I ſay) wait long for the noxious fruit of their owne hearts.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes indeed the ſeed-time and harveſt of ſin, are found in the ſame houre: and while a man hath ſcarce ended his ſin, his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment begins. The Prophet deſcribing the plenty and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church in the latter dayes, tels us, <hi>That the ploughman</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Amos 9. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes, him that ſoweth the ſeed.</hi> The returnes of ſinne are to ſome as quick and plentifull, judgement rides poſt after them, the reaper overtakes the ſower, or the man reapes, as ſoon as he hath ſowed: wrath arreſts him in the very act of ſinning. And we may ſay as <hi>Eliſha</hi> in another caſe, <hi>is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 6. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>not the ſound of his Maſters feet behinde him?</hi> The ſound of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is at the very heels of ſin. That black Oxe comes as ſwift
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40455:31"/> as a Leopard, treading upon his heeles: And though ſometimes it comes ſlowly as an Oxe, yet alwayes it treads hardeſt, when it comes ſloweſt. <hi>A wicked man may commit evill an hundred times,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>and his dayes (of peace) be prolonged,</hi> for his harveſt of wrath (like <hi>Habbakuks</hi> viſion of mercy) is for an appointed time, but in the end it will not lye, (though he would tarry for it) it will not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The naturall harveſt belies <hi>(ſc.</hi> failes) ſome mens hopes, but <note place="margin">Spem menitia ſeges.</note> this myſticall harveſt, ſhall not bely his feares (if he have any,) it ſhall bely his preſumption, how much ſoever he hath.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, obſerve, <hi>That the puniſhment of ſinne ſhall be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the degrees of ſinne.</hi> He ſhall reape, <hi>the ſame,</hi> ſaith the Text, the ſame in degree. So the Scripture ſpeakes, and ſo experience teacheth concerning naturall ſowing; a mans harveſt is gradually ſuch, as is his ſeed-time, if he have ſowne much (in an ordinary courſe) he ſhall reape much; The Apoſtle alludes to this, where he ſpeakes of the ſeed of charity, <hi>If ye ſow ſparingly, ye ſhall reape</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>ſparingly;</hi> on the other ſide, if ye ſow plentifully, ye ſhall reape plentifully. Sometimes through the judgement of God, (which can eaſily breake through the principles of nature) it commeth to paſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Ye ſow much, and reape little;</hi> God makes the harveſt thinne and leane, when the ſeed-time was thick and plentifull; but in regard of ſinning (I ſpeake of ſuch as goe on impenitently in their ſinnes, and have not Chriſt to take off their ſinne from them) ſuch perſons as ſowe much, ſhall be ſure to reape much; They ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes, who impenitently multiply their tranſgreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, obſerve, <hi>Puniſhment ſhall not exceed the deſert of ſinne. They reape the ſame;</hi> The ſame, equall in degree or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, not beyond the degree of ſinning. In nature, the corne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eap't, is more then the corne ſowne; ſometimes a hundred fold, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſixty, ſometimes thirty; as Chriſt ſpeakes, in the Parable of the Sower, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. But the puniſhment of ſinne reaped, is not a graine more then the ſin committed. All the puniſhments of this life, are leſſe then ſin, as <hi>Ezra</hi> confeſſes, <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evill deeds, and for our great treſpaſſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou our God hast puniſhed us leſſe then our iniquity, &amp;c. Chap.</hi> 9. 13. And in the life to come, the damned ſhall not be puniſhed more then ſin deſerveth; yea I may ſay (with reverence to his Almighty power) God cannot puniſh a ſin, beyond that proportion which it deſerveth; and the reaſon is this, <hi>Infinite</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:40455:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                     <hi>power, cannot inflict a puniſhment, beyond that which infinite Juſtice doth require;</hi> Infinite Juſtice is offended, and muſt be ſatisfied (if not ſatisfied by Chriſt) then by the perſon himſelfe offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: therefore infinite power, cannot lay upon a man, more then his ſin doth deſerve, though it may eaſily lay more upon him then his nature can endure. So then, all that wicked men beare in this life, is leſſe, and all they ſhall beare in hell, will not be more, then the deſerts of ſin, or the demands of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>An objection may ſeeme to lye againſt this, from that award of judgement againſt <hi>Babylon: Double to her double, according to her works,</hi> it may ſeeme that her harveſt of puniſhment muſt exceed in <note place="margin">Rev. 18. 6.</note> double proportion, her ſeed time of ſinning; The Pſalmiſt ſpeakes yet higher, <hi>Render unto our neighbours ſevenfold into their boſome, their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee O Lord.</hi> Render <note place="margin">Pſal. 79. 12.</note> ſevenfold, that is, manifold: That number in Scripture, multiplies the ſenſe into any number; To render ſevenfold, may be rendred the greateſt number.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>Babylons</hi> puniſhment ſhall be double, reſpecting what <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall have acted, but not double, reſpecting what <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> ſhall have deſerved; <hi>Give to her double;</hi> if it be poſſible, let her have as much blood more to drinke, as ſhe hath ſpilt, for ſhe deſerveth to drinke an hundred times more. The blood of Saints, is precious blood; one drop of the blood of <hi>Sion,</hi> is more worth than a whole ocean of the blood of <hi>Babylon,</hi> therefore <hi>give her double;</hi> though it be more in quantity, it is not ſo much in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. And ſo, reward our neighbours that have reproached thee ſevenfold, it is not ſevenfold beyond their deſerts; for one ſcorne that a wicked man powreth upon a childe of God (and ſo upon God, for that's the meaning of the Pſalme) cannot be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with ten thouſand reproaches, powred upon wicked men: Reproach is the due of ungodly men here, and everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſhall be their portion hereafter. But the leaſt reproach caſt upon God, is an infinite wrong; and the reproach of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is ſo much his, that he reckons it as his own: And will therefore take away all reproach from his people, and render to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde neighbours, their reproach ſevenfold (and that's but equall) into their boſomes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, When it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall reape the ſame:</hi> We are taught, <hi>That the puniſhment of ſinne, ſhall be like the ſinne in kinde;</hi> It ſhall be the ſame, not only in degree, but alſo in likeneſſe. Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40455:32"/> often beares the image and ſuperſcription of ſin upon it. You may ſee the fathers face and feature in the childe. <hi>Whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reape,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. If a man ſowe wheate, he ſhall reape wheate; the harveſt tells you what kinde of graine was ſowed in every feild: if a man ſowes wheate he, ſhall not reape tares, and if a man ſowe tares, he ſhall not reape wheate. Thus God often returnes the ſin of man upon him; ſin comes to him in its own likeneſſe, and he may reade the name of it, ſtampt upon the affliction; or by the judgement inflicted, interpret the wickedneſſe committed; This was openly confeſs'd by <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> (Judg. 1. 7.) <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited me,</hi> juſt ſo; and what was that? He ſpeakes out in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words: <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings, having their thumbes and their great tooes cut off, gathered their meate under my Table;</hi> there was his ſowing, his reaping was the ſame, <hi>They caught him</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and cut off his thumbes, and his great toes.</hi> The very firſt Law that was formally made and publiſhed after the fall, was a Law of retaliation, or of counterpaſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Whoſoever ſheddeth mans blood, (what ſhall he reape?) by man ſhall his blood be ſhed; he muſt reape the ſame:</hi> The Judicials of <hi>Moſes</hi> are plaine for this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 24. <hi>Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth, &amp;c.

                  <p>Yea, we find the Lord ſometimes dealing thus with his own deare ſervants, he will cauſe them to reape that, which they have ſowen, in kind; <hi>David</hi> had defiled his neighbours wife, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will take thy wives from before thine eyes,</hi>

Though, to themſelves and others, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as great Mountains, yet before God they are but as duſt, or chaffe of the Mountains; by a blaſt or by a breath he ſcatters and conſumes them: So <hi>David</hi> compares them <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 1. 4.) <hi>The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are not ſo,</hi> (not ſo, how? they are not as a tree planted by the waters ſide, that is the portion of the righteous; how are the ungodly then?) <hi>they are as the chaffe, that the winde ſcattereth or driveth away,</hi> the beſt of them, the moſt ſolid of them are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 17. 13.) <hi>The Nations ſhall be chaſed, as the chaffe of the mountaines before the winde, and as a rolling thing before the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde.</hi> Though Nations, mighty ſtrong powerfull Nations, come out againſt God, and his people, <hi>Fear them not:</hi> For if God ſet himſelfe againſt them, they are no more before him, then a little chaffe, he ſcatters them by the breath of his diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>You know it is no trouble for a man to breath, or to make a blaſt with his mouth; and this phraſe is uſed, to ſhew with what eaſe and facility God deſtroys all the plots and counſels of wicked men; it putteth him to no paine, no ſweating, no travel or labour to doe it; men are put to much expence of paines, and run many hazzards, to oppoſe the wickedneſs of men; but God doth it with a breath. (2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 7.) When God ſent to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to aſſure him that he would deliver him from <hi>Senacherib,</hi> he not onely promiſeth to doe it, but ſhews him how he will do it, even as in this Text, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will ſend a blaſt upon him:</hi> that's all, I will doe, I will not trouble my ſelf much about the buſineſſe; you muſt gather armies
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40455:35"/> and make great preparations againſt the enemy, but I will doe it with a blaſt.</p>
                  <p>And which is yet more ſpeedy. Some underſtand this blaſt to note only the will and pleaſure, the intent or purpoſe of God, <hi>by the blaſt of God they periſh;</hi> that is, if he doe but will it, it is done, it is no more for him to act it then intend it.

                        </gap>.</note> near this ſence, <hi>by the command of God they periſh;</hi> as if <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> had ſaid, it is as eaſie for God to doe it, as to ſay it ſhall, or to command it to be done. Men can command great things, and talke much, what they will doe; and all proves but talking and commanding: one man may command more in an houre, then a Million can doe in a year, but with God it is all one, to command &amp; accompliſh. It is noted for a high ſpeech, that of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Metellus,</hi> who oppoſing him, when he came into the Roman Treaſury, to take the money there heaped together. <hi>Caeſar</hi> (whoſe great ſpirit could not bear oppoſition) ſaith to him, <hi>Let me alone, or I will lay thee dead upon the ground.</hi> And preſently, at once to quallifie that threat and magnifie his owne power, addes, <hi>Young man it is harder for mee to ſpeak this, then to doe it.</hi> It is moſt certainly ſo with God, he can as eaſily doe any thing as ſpeak it. Yet further, we finde the eaſineſſe of Gods deſtroying his enemies ſet forth a degree higher, <hi>He doth it by a looke;</hi> as by a blaſt of his noſtrils, ſo by a caſt of his eye; that's a ſmall trouble, and that's all, that it needs coſt God to deſtroy the ſtrongeſt, the vileſt and violenteſt foe in the world: thus he conſumed the Hoaſt of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> even with a look, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 14. 24.) <hi>It came to paſſe that in the morning watch, the Lord looked unto the hoaſt of the Egyptians, through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, and troubled the hoast of the Egyptians.</hi> If God hide his face from his people they are troubled, and if he look upon his enemies they are troubled. He darts out both beams of life, and beams of death from his eyes. When a godly man is afflicted, if he can but get the Lord to look upon his trouble, he is delivered. And when wicked men proſper, if God do but look upon their glory they are withered. With ſuch eaſe doth the Scripture expreſſe the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wicked ones, it is by a breath, by a word, by a command, by a look; <hi>An intimation from the eye of God, is execution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly note; <hi>God can ſuddenly destroy the counſels and the plottings, the ploughings and the ſowings of wicked men.</hi> In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial ſpeaking, to doe a thing ſuddenly, and to doe a thing with a breath, are the ſame: God can as ſoon deſtroy his enemies, as a man
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40455:35"/> can breath; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 10. <hi>How are they brought into deſolation in a moment!</hi> A blaſt, you know, is gone in a moment: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42. 9. <hi>Theſe two things ſhall come upon thee in a moment, loſſe of children and widow-hood.</hi> God can with one breath, blow away both the husband and the children. So <hi>(Jer.</hi> 4. 20.) the Church of the Jewes ſpeaks thus, <hi>Destruction upon destruction is cryed, for the whole land is ſpoyled, ſuddenly are my tents ſpoyled, and my curtains in a moment:</hi> God doth but blow upon the Tents, and preſently the coards break, and the ſtakes thereof are looſened. If man be angry, he muſt ſit downe and conſult, he muſt lay his plot and contrive a way of revenge; but no ſooner is God angry but he can revenge; <hi>That wrath cannot want an inſtrument, which can make one. Infinite wiſdome ſees all means at once, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power can uſe them at once.</hi> As <hi>the grace of God knowes not long delayes,</hi> it comes ſwiftly, as a ſweet blaſt or holy breath, <note place="margin">Neſcit tarda molimina Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ſancti gratia.</note> Grace is ſpeedy and upon the wing; ſo likewiſe the wrath of God knows no tedious long delayes: They who doe wickedly and ſtand out impenitently, ſhall periſh ſuddenly. And though the Lord be ſlow to anger before he ſtrikes, yet when he ſtrikes, he can do it at once, it is but a blaſt of his wrath, and a breath of his diſpleaſure, and the ſtouteſt of the ſons of men are dryed like a leafe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly note, <hi>That God destroyeth wicked men ſecretly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly.</hi> To deſtroy by a breath, is a cloſe way of deſtroying. So <hi>(Hag.</hi> 1. 9.) his anger is expreſt againſt his own people, for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting his Ordinances and Temple, <hi>Yee looked for much, but loe it came to little, and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it,</hi> that is I ſent an inviſible and ſecret curſe upon it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we may obſerve from the manner of this deſtruction, <hi>That the deſtruction of wicked men, the plowers of iniquity, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable;</hi> it is done by a breath, now <hi>the winde bloweth where it listeth, no man can countercommand or ſtop the winde.</hi> The winde is ſwift, as well as ſtrong, no man can out-run the ſtrome of Gods diſpleaſure. <hi>He that fleeth of them, ſhall not flee away</hi> (for it is a <note place="margin">Amos 9. 1, 2.</note> winde that followeth them) <hi>and he that eſcapeth of them, ſhall not be delivered,</hi> it is a blaſt that is gone out after them: they cannot deliver themſelves by art or cunning, by wit or policy; they cannot deceive or cozen the winde: they cannot deliver themſelves by power or ſtrength, they cannot conquer or overcome this winde: It comes ſuddenly, inviſibly, irreſiſtibly; who can ſtand before God when he is angry, yea, who knoweth the power of his wrath or blaſt.</p>

                  <p>And the fifth word is <hi>(Laby)</hi> which ſignifies a Lion in greateſt ſtrength and fierceneſs. And the Critticks tells us, it is derived from <note place="margin">

Judah</hi> being compared to this Lion by dying <hi>Jacob,</hi> is ſet forth by his majeſtick ſtoutneſſe; <hi>Judah</hi> is a

                  <p>Theſe ſeverall ſorts of Lions ſhadow out unto us, mighty, ſtrong and powerfull wicked men, or plowers of wickedneſſe, with all related to them; they, and their families, they, and their wives, they, and their children, all theirs are uſually full of Lionlike qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and all theſe ſhall be deſtroyed and periſh, by the blaſt, by the breath of God.</p>
                  <p>For, as the Apoſtle puts the queſtion in another caſe, about Oxen, <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> So if any ſhould queſtion here, is God angry with Lions? doth he oppoſe himſelf againſt Lions, that he ſaith here, the Lion ſhall periſh, the young and the old Lions ſhall be deſtroyed?</p>
                  <p>No, there is a further meaning in it, ſomewhat elſe is ſhadowed under the name or notion of Lions. Firſt, in Scripture the Lion ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies any one in authority, eſpecially in kingly authority, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 49. 10.) the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> (which was to have the Scepter and the rule, the Magiſtracy or government being ſetled in that Tribe) is compared to a Lion, <hi>Judah is a Lions whelpe, from the prey my ſon thou art gone up, he ſtooped downe, he couched as a Lion, and as an old Lion, who ſhall rouze him up?</hi> As Lions are chiefe, the moſt eminent among the beaſts of the field, ſo Kings and Magiſtrates are chiefe, the moſt eminent among the ſons of men. Chriſt is called <hi>the Lion of the Tribe of Judah,</hi> from the prerogative of his power and the excellency of his Kingly condition above all others, his name being <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Secondly, the Devil is compared to a Lion, he is called <hi>a roaring Lion,</hi> becauſe of his cruelty and devouring nature, <hi>He goeth about like a roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devoure.</hi> And the Lions here in the Text how old ſoever they be (are whelps of this old Lion) the Devil: not great men in general, but wicked great men, men mighty in power, and mighty in ſin, mighty ſinners. It is frequent in Scripture to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out powerfull, wicked, tyrannicall men by the name of Lions, and the reaſon is, becauſe they imitate the qualities and conditions of the Lion. <hi>A man acts by reaſon, and a beaſt acts by ſence or paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> reaſon is the difference between a man and a beaſt: therefore when man either acts againſt reaſon or without reaſon, the name of a beaſt is juſtly put upon him: and the name of that beaſt moſt fitly, whoſe qualities &amp; paſſions he moſt reſembles: man in regard of his headſtrong unrulineſſe, is compared unto a Horſe and to a Mule,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40455:37"/> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 9. <hi>Be not as the Horſe or as the Mule which have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, whoſe mouth muſt be held in wit with bit and bridle.</hi> Be not unruly. For ſubtilty, man is called a Fox; for flattery or filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a Dog or a Swine; and here for rapine and cruelty a Lion. Thus the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> elegantly, Chap. 2. 11, 12. <hi>Where is the dwelling place of the Lions, and the feeding place of the young Lions?</hi> that is, where is the dwelling place of oppreſſors and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tyrants? And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19. 1, 2. <hi>Take up a lamentation for the Princes of Iſrael, and ſay, what is thy mother? a Lioneſſe, ſhe lay down among Lions, ſhe nouriſhed her whelps among young Lions;</hi> the tyrannicall Princes in Iſrael, were thus deſcribed. And ſo is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall <hi>Pharaoh (Ezek.</hi> 32. 2.) <hi>Take up a lamentation for Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh King of Egypt, and ſay unto him, thou art like a young Lion of the Nations.</hi> In generall <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 28. 15.) telleth us, <hi>That as a roaring Lion and a ranging Beare, ſo is a wicked Ruler over the poore people.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of his eſcape from the jawes of that perſecuting Emperour, ſaith (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17.) <hi>I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion;</hi> that is, out of the mouth of <hi>Nero,</hi> who was ready with open mouth to devoure and deſtroy me: or as ſome (taking it for a proverbiall ſpeech noting any eminent danger) I was delivered from the extreameſt hazard of death: even as a man reſcued out of a Lions mouth, and pull'd from between his teeth.</p>
                  <p>And it will not be amiſſe, for the clearing of this a little further, to give you ſome ſpeciall things, wherein the reſemblance may be taken, between the Tyrant, the oppreſſing Ruler, or any oppreſſing great one, and the Lion; we may draw the picture of a Tyrant by a Lions face in theſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard of his pride, ſtatelineſſe, and diſtance which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to hold, towards others. The Lyon is a proud and ſtately creature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tyrants reſemble Lions in regard of courage and animoſity. Couragiouſneſſe in any noble or good way (in which ſence <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>the righteous are bold as a Lion)</hi> is the courage of Saints. But to be valient and couragious in doing miſchiefe, in wronging and oppreſſing the weak or innocent, is the courage of a Beaſt. Courage out of the way of truth and juſtice, is Lionlike cruelty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are Lions in regard of their ſtrength.

                  <p n="4">4. They are Lions too, in regard of their ſubtilty; The Lion is a ſubtle creature, as well as a ſtrong creature, he hath a great ſtock of policy, as well as power: though we uſually oppoſe the Lions skin, and the Foxes skin, yet many times they both meete in one; Some are double skin'd as well as double cloath'd: Hence we have that phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 9. (comparing a wicked man to a Lion) <hi>he lieth in waite ſecretly, as a Lion in his den;</hi> which teacheth us, that the Lion waites and watches for his prey; And ſo doe theſe wicked men, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 17. 12.) <hi>Like as a Lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young Lion, lurking in ſecret places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are like Lions eſpecially in their cruelty, in blood-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cruelty; the Lion is a devouring beaſt, therefore when the Devill is called a Lion, it is ſaid, <hi>he goeth about to devoure.</hi> And God himſelfe (when he would be expreſt in his reſolutions of judgement, ſo as he will not have mercy upon a man, or upon a nation) is pleaſed to take upon him this name too, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>I will be unto Ephraim as a Lion, and as a young Lion to the houſe of Judah, I, even I, will teare and goe away, and none ſhall reſcue him;</hi> that is, I am reſolved to execute judgement, to the uttermoſt upon him; So Chap. 6. 1. <hi>The Lord hath torne,</hi> which is (proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the act of a Lion: And <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 10. 16.) complaines thus to God, <hi>Thoa hunteſt me like a fierce Lion:</hi> And <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 38. 13.) <hi>Hezekiah</hi> fearing, that God would not ſhew him that mercy, to raiſe him from ſickneſſe, cries out, <hi>as a Lion, ſo will he break all my bones.</hi> So that when the Lord would expreſſe himſelfe in ways of judgement, and reſolvedneſſe to goe on in judgement, he takes upon him the name of a Lion; But ſuch is the very nature of wicked men: Such the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> beſpeaks (Chap. 3. 2.) <hi>Heare this O heads of Jacob, and ye Princes of the houſe of Iſrael, it is not for you to know judgement? who hate the good and love the evill, who pluck off their skins from off them, and their fleſh from off their bones;</hi> noting Lion-like cruelty in thoſe, who ſhould have been as ſheapheards to feed and protect the people.</p>

The Naturaliſts obſerve, that though many creatures are ſwifter of foot, then the Lion, yet when he roareth, they fall downe, and he overtakes them with his aſtoniſhing voyce; ſo tyrannicall men, with their roaring words, their loud threatnings, often affright and daunt the poor.</p>

                  <p>Thus you ſee, both who are here meant by Lions, and likewiſe, how the reſemblance or picture of a wicked man, may be taken from a Lion.</p>
                  <p>Now when it is ſaid, that, <hi>the teeth of the Lions are broken, that the old Lions periſh, and the young Lions are ſcattered abroad:</hi> By all theſe expreſſions of ſcattering, periſhing and being broken to peeces, the Holy Ghoſt ſhewes us, the utter, full and finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of wicked men; they are not only touched, troubled and rouſed up out of their dens; but theſe Lions, old and young, are ſcattered and conſumed, <hi>They periſh.</hi>

                  <p>But I rather conceive the former expoſition of the words, to be the truth, and moſt ſutable to the context; and there is this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be given, becauſe it agrees beſt with the purpoſe of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> whoſe worke was, ſo to deſcribe the deſtruction of wicked men in generall, that he might particularly intimate the deſtruction, fallen upon <hi>Job</hi> and his family, with the reaſon of it. <hi>Job</hi> was a great man in his time; he was among men, as the Lion among beaſts, <hi>a chiefe.</hi> His friends thought him a cruell Lion too, and ſo he is told to his face afterward, by one of them, that he (like a greedy Lion) <hi>had taken away the pledge, and the garment from the poore;</hi> This <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> would hint at leaſt to <hi>Job,</hi> and that God had found him out in his Lion-like qualities; that he being a Magiſtrate, and a man in authority, having dealt hardly and cruelly with others, now the Lord had meaſured to him, the ſame meaſure he had given others; He, the Lion; and ſhe, the fierce Lion or Lioneſſe his wife; they, the young Lions, his children, were all broken, and either periſhed or periſhing. So much for the cleering of the words; I ſhall now adde ſome obſervations from them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Wicked men, how powerfull, how ſtrong ſoever, ſhall fall before the wrath and indignation of God. The day of the Lord ſhall be againſt every one that is high, and that is lifted up.</hi> God deſires in a ſpeciall manner, to be dealing with theſe, for they, in the pride of their ſpirits, think themſelves a match for God; though indeed, their ſtrength be but weakneſſe, and their wiſdome foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe; yet in their own conceits they are ſtronger, and wiſer then God himſelfe. Hence (like <hi>Pharaoh)</hi> they ſend defiance to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord,</hi> Exod. 5. 1. When God ſees the hearts of men ſwolne to this height, of inſolent madneſſe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to ſhew himſelfe, and graple with them, that the pride of man may be abaſed, and every one that is exalted may be laid low:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40455:39"/> that he only may be exalted, and his Name ſet up in that day; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was much troubled, at that murther of <hi>Abner,</hi> yet he could not take vengeance preſently, upon the fierce Lion, that had ſuckt his blood. Why? his power did not reach it, <hi>ye ſonnes of Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are too hard for me,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3.) But there are no ſonnes of <hi>Zerviah</hi> too hard for God, no Lions ſo ſtrong, but he can teare them, with infinitely more eaſe, then a Lion can the tender kid.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould comfort us, when we ſee great and potent enemies riſing up againſt the Church, what are theſe before the great Lion, the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> If the Lord doe but roare, if the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> come againſt theſe Lions, they will run like a heard of fearfull deare: <hi>The Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefe Captaines, and the mighty men,</hi> are deſcribed, <hi>trembling at the preſence of Chriſt, when he appeared but as a Lambe,</hi> Rev. 6. 15, 16. <hi>They cry to the mountaines and the rockes, to fall upon them, and to hide them from his face;</hi> If when Chriſt appeares like an angry Lambe, the greateſt in the world fall before him; what then will theſe doe, when Chriſt ſhall appeare as a roaring Lion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly obſerve, how gradually the Holy Ghoſt expreſſes the deſtruction of wicked tyrants; All is not done at once; Firſt the roaring of the Lion doth periſh, then their voice, then their teeth are pulled out, next, their prey is taken away, laſtly, their whelps are ſcattered. Note hence, <hi>That uſually God deſtroyes wicked men by degrees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are five ſteps or degrees of Gods juſtice, againſt theſe Lions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſtops the roaring of the Lions, they ſhall not be able to make ſuch a dreadfull noiſe as heretofore; their roaring may be ſtopt, when their voice is not, though they can ſpeake, yet they ſhall not yell.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, He breakes the very voice of the Lions; they ſhall not only not roare, but they ſhall not ſo much as ſpeake, either againſt the lambes, or againſt the ſheepe, or for themſelves, <hi>the voice of the fierce Lion ſhall be taken away.</hi> God is able to ſilence Lions, and ſtop their mouths, not only from devouring and roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but from ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When their voice is taken away and their roaring, yet their teeth may remaine: and there will be biting and tearing ſtill, though they have done roaring and yelling; therefore with a third
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40455:39"/> ſtroake God breakes out their teeth, <hi>the teeth of the young Lions are broken.</hi> So the Pſalmiſt prayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 6. <hi>Breake their teeth in their mouthes, breake out the great teeth of the young Lions O Lord:</hi> that is, take away the inſtruments, by which they oppreſſe, the meanes by which they teare and rend, as Lions with their cruell teeth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt deales further with theſe Lions, he not only breakes their teeth, by which they uſed to hurt others, but he takes away their prey and their meate, they ſhall not have wherewith to live themſelves; they were wont to ſuck the blood of the ſlaine, and to eate the fleſh of the poore; but now the Lord will pluck away their prey, they themſelves ſhall be ſtarved or pincht with hunger.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Not only ſhall their meate be taken away, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall be ſcattered and diſperſed, that is the laſt ſtep of their calamity. Their dens ſhall be broken up, and their lurking places ſhall be opened; they ſhall run from place to place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from Nation to Nation. This is the judgement of the Lord upon Lions, and the portion of the cruell enemies from our God.</p>
                  <p>Who hath not ſeen the truth of all this in our dayes; we have had Lions, roaring Lions, rending, tearing Lions amongſt us: It was uſuall among the Heathens in their perſecutions, to cry out, <hi>Away with the Chriſtians to the Lions:</hi> This we have often <note place="margin">Chriſtianos ad Leones.</note> ſeene, in the figure, poore Chriſtians ſent to the Lions, put under the power of men, as cruell, as bloody, as inſatiable as Lions: Many a one might ſay (as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 57. 4.) <hi>My ſoule is among Lions:</hi> When the watch-man (in the Prophet) was asked, <hi>Watch-man what of the night?</hi> he anſwered. <hi>A Lion my Lord (Iſa.</hi> 21. 7.) Our ſorrowfull watch-men, ſtanding upon their Towres, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering thoſe ſad times) being asked, what of the day? have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>We ſee a Lion, a company of Lions. tearing and rending in many parts of the Nation;</hi> not bodies and eſtates only, but ſoules and conſciences. God hath wonderfully delivered his darling from the Lions, his <hi>Daniels</hi> from the Lions den: He hath already delivered us ſo farre, that the Lions dare not roare, as they were wont, the teeth of many of the young Lions are broken, many of the old Lions are ready to periſh for want of prey, and not a few of their whelps are ſcattered abroad; God hath raiſed up <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to teare theſe Lions, which roared upon us; he hath ſtirred up <hi>Davids</hi> to ſmite theſe Lions, and reſcue the prey out of their teeth:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40455:40"/> And though many Lions are amongſt us, yet they dare not roare, much leſſe, teare as they have done; though the beaſts be alive, yet (for the moſt part) the Lions are dead: they are beaſts ſtill, as baſe, and vile, and bloody in their natures as ever, but their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Lion-like ſtrength is abated: That glorious prophecie, is in ſome ſenſe, and in ſome part, fulfilled at this day; <hi>The wholfe dwels with the lambe, the leopard lies downe with the kid, and the calfe and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little childe may leade them; they cannot, they dare not, hurt nor deſtroy in all our mountaine,</hi> Iſa. 11. 6, 8. I am ſure, we may ſet our ſeale to this truth of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> we have ſeene Lions, and fierce Lions, old Lions, and young Lions, even the ſtout Lions whelps, ſome ſcattered abroad, ſome deſtroyed, ſome conſumed by the mighty power of God.</p>
                  <p>Further, It is here ſaid in the text, <hi>That the old Lion ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of prey:</hi> It is a ſtrange expreſſion, Lions have the greateſt power to get proviſion, to ſatisfie their hunger, yea their appetites and humour, yet theſe ſhall want; theſe Lions, who have all their life time, preyed upon the eſtates of other men, even theſe ſhall want. Note hence the juſtice of God; <hi>Such as have made others want, ſhall at last come to want themſelves, they ſhall periſh for want of prey,</hi> they ſhall have nothing to eate: <hi>when thou cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt to ſpoile, thou ſhalt be ſpoiled,</hi> ſaith the Prophet; <hi>and when</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa</hi> 33. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>thou ſhalt make an end to deale treacherouſly, they ſhall deale trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly with thee:</hi> We muſt not underſtand it, as if wicked men doe ever give over ſinning, ſinne, and their deſire of ſinning, is in a kinde infinite: they never ſay, now we have done, and will ſin no more; but the meaning is, when thou canſt ſin no more, nor deale treacherouſly any more, when thou haſt done thy utmoſt, and ſpent thy ſtrength in ſpoiling others, or taken all their ſpoile, ſo that thou haſt done ſpoiling, becauſe there is no more to ſpoile, then others ſhall ſpoile thee; And thou Lion, who haſt preyed upon others a long time, ſhalt not have a bit thy ſelfe, but ſhalt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of prey.</p>
                  <p>It is the promiſe of God unto his own people <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 34. 10. <hi>That the Lions ſhall lack and ſuffer hunger, but they that feare the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing:</hi> He expreſſes it by Lions, to note, that certainly they that feare him ſhall not want, for if any creatures in the world can preſerve themſelves from hunger, Lions can; if they doe but roare, the very beaſts will fall downe as a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40455:40"/> prey before them, but yet (ſaith God) theſe even theſe ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther periſh for hunger, than any one that feareth me ſhall want. God provides for his lambes, for innocent perſons, for thoſe who feare him, though they have no ſtrength to provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but the wicked who have greateſt power, and have been moſt active to provide for themſelves, ſhall pine with want; they who have cauſed ſo many to be bitten with hunger, ſhall at laſt be hunger-bitten, and for want of meate, gnaw their tongues.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Where it is ſaid, that the Lions whelps are ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, Obſerve, <hi>God will not onely deſtroy the perſons of wicked men, but their families and poſterities,</hi> they and their whelps ſhall all be ſcattered; <hi>he will not leave them ſo much, as a name or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> (Pſal. 36. 6.) <hi>I ſought his place</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>and he could not be found;</hi> there was no print of him, no man could remember, that there was ſuch a man in the world, unleſſe to curſe his memory.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only give one caution reſpecting this, and ſo conclude the point. That which is here affirmed in the generall by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> concerning the deſtruction of wicked men, Lions and fierce Lions, is not to be taken as a truth in the univerſall experience of it; we are not to underſtand it thus, as if all perſons, all Lion-like perſons at all times, periſh, and are deſtroyed, and ſcattered abroad: But <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks of what is uſually done: or he ſpeaks of what God can eaſily doe at any time, and of what God may juſtly doe at all times. Lions, fierce Lions, tyrants, oppreſſors, he both may and can ſcatter when he pleaſeth. Yet we find, that God hath permitted ſome Lions, to live fully, and to die quietly; they ſpend all their dayes in roaring and rending, in tearing and devouring, and yet themſelves are not devoured: God often ſuſpends this Juſtice, but it is for weighty reaſons; for, in a word,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If God ſhould deſtroy all Lion-like men, the joynts of the world would be unlooſed, and the bands of humane ſociety broken aſunder. God forbad the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to deſtroy all the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites,</hi> leaſt the beaſts of the field ſhould multiply, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God ſhould hunt all theſe Lions out of the world, his own people would live by ſenſe, rather then by faith; and ſeeme to be terrified by the viſible actings of wrath, rather then allured by the promiſes of mercy, or tenders of free-grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He deferres them, untill they have ſucked blood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, rent enough, and done evill enough, even fill'd up the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40455:41"/> meaſure of their ſin, and fulfill'd the righteous purpoſe of God, by their unrighteouſneſſe. As theſe Lions fill their own bellies, ſo they fulfill Gods counſels, therefore he lets them alone, that they may doe his worke, though they little thinke of it, and leſſe intend it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks of what God did frequently, in thoſe times of the world, wherein they lived; for then God dealt more by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward judgements, then in theſe Goſpel times. <hi>As his mercies are now more ſpirituall, ſo uſually are his judgements.</hi>

                  <p>His Argument taken from Divine authority lies in the former five Verſes of this context, <hi>(ſc.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.) I may give it thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That is to be received as a truth, which God from heaven imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately declareth to his ſervant, in a viſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But God hath declared and revealed this to me, in a viſion, that</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40455:41"/> 
                     <hi>he who contends with God, carrieth himſelfe very ſinfully.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore it is to be received as a truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt part of the Argument is unqueſtionable; that it is a truth which God revealeth from Heaven in a Viſion. And that God had revealed this unto <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> from Heaven in a Viſion, he himſelfe at large declareth in thoſe five Verſes, deſcribing both the manner how, and the time when this truth was revealed to him.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Argument from reaſon, is grounded upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon logicall rule, of arguing from the greater to the leſſe, <hi>(Verſ.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21.) The ſumme of it may be thus conceived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which would be folly and ſinfull boldneſſe in Angels, if they ſhould aſpire and take upon them to doe, is much more ſinfull in a mortall man.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But if Angels ſhould goe about to juſtifie themſelves, or ſtand upon termes with God, it would be ſinne and folly in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore it is much more ſinne and folly in mortall man, to juſtifie himſelfe before God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Major or the firſt propoſition is undeniable. The ſecond propoſition is proved and illuſtrated to the end of the Chapter. Wherein is ſhewed in what condition man now ſtandeth: how weak and how poore a thing a man is compared unto an Angel; therefore if it would be ſinne and folly in Angels to compare with God, it muſt much more be ſinne and folly in man. So we ſee how <hi>Eliphaz</hi> confirmes the major propoſition of the firſt Syllogiſme.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond propoſition or aſſumption which he inferres upon <hi>Job, But thou Job carrieſt thy ſelfe ſo as if thou wert more juſt than God:</hi> he proves by that ſad expoſtulation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. And takes that for granted. We may forme it thus.</p>
                  <p>He that complaineth of God, as if he had done him wrong, makes himſelfe more juſt then God.</p>
                  <p>But thou <hi>Job,</hi> haſt made ſuch a complaint, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. as if God had done thee wrong in afflicting thee, or in giving and in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing thy life under ſuch afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, thou ſeemeſt to make thy ſelfe more juſt, then God, or to ſay that God hath dealt unjuſtly or injuriouſly with thee.</p>
                  <p>This I take to be the Logick of the remaining part of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And having cleared his manner of reaſoning in generall, I ſhall deſcend to open particulars.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:40455:42"/> Now a thing was ſecretly brought unto me, and mine eare recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a little thereof.</q>
                  <p>I muſt yet reſolve a queſtion before I explaine the tearms; the queſtion is this. Whether this were a true viſion ſent from God, or whether it were only feined by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> thereby to gain authority to what he ſpake?</p>
                  <p>There are many Expoſitors of great name, who are very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that this viſion was a fiction or holy fraud; a viſion of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> his own braine, not a viſion from Heaven. Some have gone further, maintaining that it was a viſion ſent from Hell, an illuſion of the Devill, thereby to ſtrengthen the hands of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> in vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and troubling <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, but that many have pretended viſions from God, when they have received none; they have belyed the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty with their Dreams and Revelations, when they have ſeen nothing. Thus (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 11.) <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the falſe Prophet takes upon him, to have had a viſion from God, by which he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <hi>Ahab</hi> in his counſell to goe up to <hi>Ramoth Gilead. And Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah the ſonne of Chenaanah made him hornes of iron, and he ſaid, thus ſaith the Lord, with theſe ſhalt thou puſh the Syrians till thou have conſumed them.</hi> And in the propheſie of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> you have <hi>Hananiah</hi> the falſe Prophet, not onely ſpeaking the language, but dreſſing himſelfe in all the formalities of a viſion; he comes forth with a yoke upon his neck, and breakes it before the people, and telleth them, thus will God break the yoke of your captivity, and at ſuch a time.</p>
                  <p>The true Prophets complaine often of the falſe, for crying up their deceivings, under the warrant of viſions and dreams, when all was but a dreame indeed, a meere phancy, or ſtudied impoſture to miſlead the people, and gaine credit to their lies. While a man hath nothing but ordinary humane authority, for things extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, he is eaſily rejected.</p>
                  <p>Man is ſubject to error, he may deceive and be deceived; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they would put <hi>a new nothing</hi> upon the world, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible truth, and have it ſwallowed without chewing, received without diſputing, then uſually they pretended that it was <hi>(quid Divinum)</hi> a doctrine or meſſage received immediately from God. And it is well obſerved, that this courſe of pretending to Divine revelation, was very frequent amongſt the Heathen: when their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40455:42"/> Wiſe men had a minde to faſten, ſome unwonted opinion upon the vulgar. Among the Romans, <hi>Numa,</hi> (to the intent they might be received with greater authority) ſtampt his lawes, with a kinde of divinity, and told the people that he had received them from the Goddeſſe <hi>Aegeria.</hi> As if he had ſaid, theſe lawes, are not ſuch as I have coyned and faſhioned by my owne policy, drawne up or ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by my own power, I had them from the Goddeſſe. So <hi>Plato</hi> informes us of another law-maker <hi>(Minos</hi> the <hi>Cretian)</hi> that he uſed to enter into Caves and ſolitary places, where (he told the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) he received lawes and immediate dictates from <hi>Jupiter</hi> their God, to governe them by. This drew a great eſtimation and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence upon him. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> tels us of thoſe <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Valer. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Herod. lib.</hi> 1.</note> other Law-makers, <hi>Licurgus</hi> and <hi>Seuleucus,</hi> uſing the like State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratagems to over-rule the people. <hi>Licurgus</hi> ſaid, he received his lawes from <hi>Apollo: Zaleucus</hi> and <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> avouch, <hi>Minerva</hi> for the Directreſſe or Doctreſſe of <hi>Theirs.</hi> So that both among the people of God, and among Heathens, it hath been very frequent to pretend Divine authority; that they might with the more eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation put off either ſuch points of doctrine, or ſuch rules of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as themſelves had invented.</p>
                  <p>For this of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> howſoever ſome charge him directly, and <note place="margin">

Yet I ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to reſolve directly, that his was a true viſion, as well as a viſion of truth ſent from God. And the reaſons which ſway with me are theſe three.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if we conſider the manner of this viſion, the deſcription here made, holds exact proportion with thoſe, of which there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but they were the Oracles of Heaven. <hi>When a thing is done as God doth it, it is ſome argument that God hath done it.</hi> I grant, this reaſon is not demonſtrative or infallible, becauſe Satan and our own hearts are very apt to make imitations of holy things, for ſinfull ends. Satan can transforme himſelfe into an Angel of light, and the heart can diſguiſe or ſhape its own dark conceptions, by the light of divine revelations.</p>
                  <p>Take then a ſecond reaſon, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> was a godly man. 'Tis gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on all hands, that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his friends were right in their affections, though they failed in this action. God was angry with them indeed, &amp; told them in the cloſe of this diſpute <hi>(Chap</hi> 42. 7.) <hi>That they had not ſpoken of him the thing that was right, as Job his</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40455:43"/> 
                     <hi>ſervant had,</hi> yet <hi>he bids Job pray and offer ſacrifice for them,</hi> which he would not have done, unleſſe they had been upon good termes with him in generall, and in a preſent capacity, for mercy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. Now it being ſuppoſed that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> was a godly man, it is a ſinne not to be ſuppoſed of him, that he would make boaſt of a falſe revelation, and with ſuch deliberate gravity put a lye upon God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the matter which he profeſſes to have received in this viſion, is a great and a holy truth of God. Man never belyes God to confirme the truth of God. When any boaſt vainly of revelations, it is to confirme their own phancies and deluſions. 'Tis rare when men are ſo zealous for truth, as to improve all that God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the maintenance of it; I have not read of any that have fained a word from God, to maintaine that which is really the Word of God. We finde all along in Scripture, that when viſions from God were falſely pretended, they ever tended to ſecure the heart in falſe opinions, or unwarrantable practiſes.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> found many who falſified the ſtampe of the Spirit, and forged his hand and ſeale to eſtabliſh error (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 2.) <hi>I beſeech you brethren, that you be not ſoone ſhaken in minde, or be troubled either by ſpirit, or by word, or by letter, as from us, as that the day of Chriſt is at hand.</hi> That groſſe error was ſcattered in the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> that the day of Chriſt was at hand, that in thoſe beginnings of the Goſpell, there ſhould be an end of all things. To confirme this, falſe teachers boaſted of the Spirit, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revelation from God: or a word immediately from the mouth, or a Letter under the hand of <hi>Paul.</hi> How active is error to finde patronage? It cares not whom it belyes, ſo it ſelfe may paſſe for truth. Thouſands love errours, but none will own them by that name. And therefore (becauſe children bear their fathers name) they would father them upon the God of truth, or upon men, moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for truth. <hi>Montanus</hi> the Heretick, ſaid he had the Holy Ghoſt his <hi>Paracl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>te,</hi> dictating thoſe erroneous doctrines to him, beſide <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hiſtor. Eccl. l.</hi> 5 <hi>c.</hi> 14, 16.</note> his Propheteſſes, <hi>Priſca</hi> and <hi>Mavinilla. Mahomet,</hi> that <hi>Grand hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Impoſtor</hi> often pretended viſions from Heaven. And the ſtory aſſures us that he cunningly made uſe of the diſeaſe of his body, to perſwade his Diſciples of the ſoundneſſe of his doctrine. For being afflicted with <hi>the falling ſickneſſe,</hi> when at any time a fit was upon him he made the people believe that he was in an extaſie or raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpirit, at the appearance of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> who revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40455:43"/> many myſteries to him. And having by long uſe and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity taught a Pigeon to ſeed at his eare, he by art prevailed with the people, to feed at his poyſonous mouth: as if his words had been the inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt, who (as he affirmed) came then to him, in the forme of a Dove, and taught him thoſe ſecrets.</p>
                  <p>So then, this of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> was a true viſion, becauſe it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of a truth. Invented viſions are in uſe only to gaine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the inventions of man, or the viſions of the Devill. Now for the matter and words themſelves.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now a thing, or a word, was brought unto me,</hi> it was brought unto me ſecretly. The language of the Prophets was, <hi>The word of the Lord came unto me.</hi> There are two words in our tranſlation, <hi>(ſecretly brought,)</hi> but the Hebrew is one; and that word ſignifies to ſteale, or to do a thing by ſtealth; ſo it may be tranſlated, <hi>A thing was brought unto me by ſtealth, or was ſtole into me:</hi> M <hi>Broughton</hi> near this, <hi>A ſpeech came by ſtealth upon me;</hi> we tranſlate fully to the ſenſe, <hi>A thing was ſecretly brought to me,</hi> as if it were whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered into the eare, and ſent in cloſely to the ſpirit. And it is thus expreſſed, by way of oppoſition to another way, in which God reveales his minde unto his people. He ſometimes comes openly and ſpeaks aloud, that all may take notice, or becauſe all ought. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 1. <hi>Cry aloud, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet.</hi> Things are brought openly to the people, ſecretly to the Prophets; what the Lord ſpeaks in the eare, or to the heart of a Prophet, that he by the Prophet ſpeaks on the houſe top, to all his people. <hi>A thing was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly brought, or a thing was whiſpered unto Eliphaz.</hi> But he ſpeaks it aloud to <hi>Job.</hi> This word or this thing, is ſaid to be ſtolne into him, or to be brought unto him by ſtealth, for three reaſons, which I ſhall but name and proceed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a thing done by ſtealth, is done ſuddenly. The Thiefe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens to doe miſchiefe, he makes no delayes. Then ſecondly, a thing done by ſtealth is done ſecretly: a Thiefe comes cloſely in the dark;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40455:44"/> ſtealth is committed with greateſt privacy; and to ſay a thing is brought by ſtealth, is as much as to ſay, it is brought privately. Thirdly, a thing done by ſtealth, is done unexpectedly. A man ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome looks for the Thiefe, he is upon him in the way, upon him in his houſe, before he is aware. A Thiefe is uſually as unexpected, as he is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> unwelcome gueſt So this word came or was brought in by ſtealth, becauſe it came, ſuddely, it came ſilently, and it came unexpectedly to <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> And in theſe three reſpects, Chriſt himſelfe is ſaid to come as a Thiefe, <hi>Behold I come as a thiefe in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 16. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>the night.</hi> As the word of Chriſt comes to many of his people now, ſo the perſon of Chriſt will come at the laſt unto all, <hi>He will come by ſtealth, or as a thiefe,</hi> ſuddenly, ſecretly, unexpectedly, when the world ſhall little dreame of him, and his Church ſcarce be awake for him.</p>
                  <p>Note from this, firſt, <hi>That divine truths are infuſed into us, not borne in us, or borne with us;</hi> every thing which is of Heaven, commeth unto us from Heaven; it is either ſtolne in ſecretly, or thundred in loudly: ſometimes the Prophets and Miniſters of Chriſt, ſpeaking aloud, carry truth into the ſoule: ſometimes God whiſpers it into the ſoule; one way or other, truth muſt be brought in, for it growes not in us: our hearts by nature are not onely like white paper, having no inſcription, not a letter of Gods will writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in them, but they are like paper blotted or blurred, written all over with the corrupt principles, and poſitions of our own wils. God by his Spirit firſt croſſes or wipes out thoſe, and then writes down his own golden rules, of holy truth and heavenly wiſdome. This he doth, firſt in converſion from ſinne to grace and holineſſe, and afterward in all the increaſes of grace, and growths of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>There is not a ſyllable of the law of God in any mans heart, till the finger of God writes it there; I will put my law in their minde, and write it in their hearts,</hi> which is an alluſion unto the two Tables of the Law. They were firſt written by the finger of God, and then put into the Ark: So God firſt writes the Law in our hearts, and then puts it into our mindes; he layes it up in the Ark of our underſtanding and memory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly obſerve, <hi>That God ſteales truths into the hearts of his people unawares.</hi> As they often expect and wait long for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo they ſometimes know before they expect. A truth either in whole or part, in the matter or clearer light of it, comes like a Thief into the heart, ſuddenly, ſecretly, unlooked for: in which caſe it is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40455:44"/> ever true, <hi>that truth unexpected is doubly welcom'd.</hi> The way of the Spirit of God is alwayes undiſcernable to fleſh and blood. The ſoule receives a thing, and the man knowes not how; he can (ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, not at all) tell where, by whom, or which way it came to him; it was brought, ſecretly brought; and with a moſt bleſſed, gracious ſlight of hand, conveyed into his heart. Yet ſometime truth enters in <hi>State,</hi> &amp; may be ſaid to make its paſſage viſibly, into the heart of a man. The word comes, not as a company of Thieves, but as a band of Souldiers, with weapons drawn, and terrible ſhouts, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the ſoule, and breaking open the iron gate of the heart, lock'd and barr'd with unbeliefe, to ſecure that curſed crue of luſts, garriſon'd within it. <hi>The weapons of our warfare</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are mighty, through God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4. The word is mighty, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in ſtrength, it comes upon the ſoule as an armed man, to ſpoyle it of all ſinfull treaſures, yea of the very life of ſinne. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord proclaimes warre, as by a Herald of Armes againſt a man and openly prepares for his ſiege and battery. He ſurpriſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and ſteals him into a happy captivity to himſelfe.</p>

And though he had not all of every part, yet he had a part of all; it was not a little of this, and none of that: little reſpects ſomewhat of every truth, not ſome one truth. He received, though not all, yet a perfect modell of all, that was brought.</p>
                  <p>Further, this ſpeech may have reference unto our preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning which the Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) <hi>We know but in part:</hi> now when he ſaith, <hi>we know but in part;</hi> it is not as if we had but a part of Gods will, made knowne unto us.

A wicked mans higheſt and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt thoughts are for the earth, his thoughts for the earth, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow all his other thoughts: But a godly mans thoughts, for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ſpirituals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> outgrow all his other thoughts, his thoughts for Heaven, are the higheſt and uppermoſt branches of his ſoule. We have this word uſed, in the 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 21. <hi>How long</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah) will you halt between two opinions?</hi> That word which we there tranſlate <hi>opinions,</hi> is here tranſlated <hi>thoughts;</hi> hence ſome render that in the <hi>Kings</hi> thus, <hi>How long doe ye halt between two top-thoughts, or high thoughts?</hi> As if this were the thing, which <hi>Elijah</hi> reproved in that people, that they had high thoughts, both <hi>of God and of Baal,</hi> top-thoughts of both: and they (as it were) ſet <hi>Baal,</hi> a dumb Idol, as high in their thoughts, eſtimations and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as they did the living God. Why do ye halt between two up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt opinions, higheſt thoughts, or thoughts of equall height, concerning <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Baal?</hi> Your thoughts of your Idol, are as high as of God himſelfe. What! will you make an Idoll, equall with God? An Idoll is a baſe thing, a low thing, a thing below up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dung-hill (therefore called a dunghill god) The true God, is on high, he is in the higheſt Heavens, he is higher than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40455:47"/> of Heavens, and doe you debaſe him thus, by halting between two thoughts of equall height, concerning Him and <hi>Baal?

                  <p>And to cleere it yet further; <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 119. 13.) the ſame word is uſed by <hi>David,</hi> when he profeſſes, <hi>I hate vaine thoughts,</hi> or as ſome reade it, <hi>I hate vaine things;</hi> He calls Idolatrous thoughts <hi>vaine thoughts,</hi> becauſe they are wavering, inconſtant or unſetled thoughts, in further alluſion to the boughes of a tree: as the top-moſt and higheſt boughes of a tree, are ſhaken with every puffe of wind, and waver too and fro with every blaſt, ſo are the thoughts <note place="margin">Quaſi dicat I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatriam odio habui, quae plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra eminentia ſupremo cultu reveretur, cum ſit unum.</note> of Idolaters: or becauſe (as before) Idolatry ſets up <hi>Too high Thoughts,</hi> adoring an Idoll as much, or in competition and rivali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the everliving God. The higher our thoughts are of God, the more excellent they are; but the higher our thoughts are of falſe worſhip, the vainer they are; and to have as high thoughts of an Idoll, as of the living and true God, are the vaineſt thoughts of all; thoſe high thoughts are low thoughts, the loweſt thoughts, thoughts moſt hatefull, <hi>I hate vaine thoughts.</hi>

                  <p>Viſions were a ſpeciall way of divine revelation: <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

                     <hi>by the Prophets,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. God ſpake at ſundry times, and he ſpake in divers manners. Now amongſt thoſe divers manners of ſpeaking, ſpeaking by or in viſions was one. The Jewiſh Doctors, obſerve foure degrees of divine revelation. The firſt they <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Paulus Fagius, in</hi> Exod. 28.</note> called <hi>Prophecie,</hi> which included viſion, and any apparition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the will of God was made known. They had a ſecond way of <note place="margin">Goodw. Hebr. Antiq.</note> divine revelation, which they called, <hi>The inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whereby the party was inabled, without viſion or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, to propheſie: either as propheſying is taken for the foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of things to come, or for the reſolving of things in doubt: The Rabbins give us the difference between theſe two, <hi>prophecie and inſpiration:</hi> In <hi>prophecie</hi> (though it was from the Holy Ghoſt) a man was caſt into a trance, or brought into an extaſie, his ſenſes being taken away; but ſpeaking by inſpiration of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, was without any ſuch change in, or impreſſions upon the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40455:47"/> body; So <hi>David,</hi> and other Pen-men of the Scriptures, wrote by the immediate inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, yet without viſible apparitions to them, or viſible change upon them. Thirdly, God revealed himſelfe, by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which was an anſwer given by the <hi>Ephod,</hi> or by the ſtones that were on the breaſt-plate of the <hi>high Prieſt.</hi> Theſe three wayes of <hi>divine revelation</hi> (as they obſerve) ceaſed in the <hi>ſecond Temple.</hi> The Jewiſh writers having this tradition, That after the latter Prophets, <hi>Haggai, Zechariah</hi> and <hi>Malachy, the Holy Ghoſt departed from Iſrael;</hi> meaning, the Holy Ghoſt (not in the ordinarie work of ſanctification, but) in thoſe extraordinary wayes of prophecy, inſpiration, and of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> went up and departed from them. There was yet a fourth way of divine revelation, which they call <hi>Bathcoll,</hi> the daughter of a voice, or eccho, declaring the will of God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Heaven: ſuch ſome conceive to be, the voice heard from Heaven, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 1. proclaiming the teſtimonie of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, <hi>a voice was heard from Heaven, ſaying, this is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to paſſe from theſe traditions of the Jewes, we ſhall give you the doctrine of divine revelations, more diſtinctly from the Scriptures. We finde <hi>(Numb.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8.) three diſtinct wayes, in which the Lord revealed himſelfe of old unto his people. <hi>If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my ſelfe known unto him in a viſion, and will ſpeake unto him in a dreame; My ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> Moſes <hi>is not ſo, who is faithfull in all mine houſe, with him will I ſpeake mouth to mouth, even apparently; and not in darke ſpeeches, and the ſimilitude of the Lord ſhall he behold.</hi> This is an illuſtrious text, deſcribing three diſtinct wayes or degrees of holy revelation. Firſt, by viſion which we have here in <hi>Job.</hi> Secondly, by a <hi>Dreame,</hi> which was when God preſented ſomewhat to them ſleeping: This kinde of revelation God vouchſafed, not only to his own people and Prophets, but to Heathens alſo and ſtrangers from his Covenant. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had a revelation by a dreame <hi>(Gen.</hi> 41.) concerning the ſeven yeares of famine; and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had a wonderfull revelation by a dreame <hi>(Dan.</hi> 2.) concerning the ſtate of the foure Monarchies. The wiſe men of the Eaſt, were warned in a dreame, to returne into their Countrey another way, <hi>Math.</hi> 2. But with the Saints, theſe revelations by dreames, were very frequent; <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 28.) in a dreame, as he ſlept upon a ſtone, <hi>ſaw a ladder, &amp;c. Joſeph, Jacobs</hi> ſon, had ſo many dreames,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40455:48"/> that his brethren jeered him with it, and called him, <hi>the Captaine-dreamer, The dreamer, a Maſter of dreames,</hi> Gen. 37. 19. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                        </gap>
                     </note> the husband of <hi>Mary,</hi> was twice warned in a dreame, firſt that he ſhould not forſake his wife, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. and then that he ſhould goe into <hi>Egypt, Mat.</hi> 3. Many other the like revelations by dreames, might be inſtanced in, but I forbeare. There is a third way ſpoken of in this text, and that is, <hi>ſpeaking mouth to mouth; my ſervant</hi> Moſes <hi>is not ſo, with him will I ſpeake mouth to mouth, even apparently.</hi> This is a more eminent way of heavenly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations than the former; <hi>Moſes</hi> had a priviledge above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prophets. For <hi>to ſpeake mouth to mouth,</hi> is expounded (by <hi>Apparently) I will ſpeake plainely or apparently,</hi> not in a viſion or in a dreame; When a man ſpeakes mouth to mouth to his friend, or (as the Scripture phraſes our communion with God, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) <hi>face to face;</hi> This is oppoſed to a more remote or obſcure communion. As our ſeeing God face to face in Heaven, ſo his ſpeaking to us, mouth to mouth on earth, notes the cleareſt and fulleſt revelation: It is to give us his minde, nakedly, without any figure or ſhadow; or (as Chriſt is ſaid once in the Goſpel) to <hi>ſpeake plainely, and not in Parables.</hi> And theſe ſpeakings <hi>mouth to mouth,</hi> were of two ſorts: Either immediate, as himſelfe did unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> or as to others, by the miniſtry of Angels; God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten employed Angels in this ſervice, to declare his minde, and bring meſſages to his people; This was a kinde of ſpeaking <hi>mouth to mouth:</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> had an honour beyond this, <hi>with him will I ſpeake mouth to mouth,</hi> I by my ſelfe, not I, by a created Angell.</p>
                  <p>Viſions (to keep to the terme in hand) were (you ſee) a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall meanes, by which God broke his minde, and unlockt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his counſels. <hi>If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my ſelfe known unto him in a viſion.</hi> And to cleere this point about viſions yet more fully; We may diſtinguiſh of divers ſorts of viſions. Firſt, A viſion is ſometime put for any ordinary diſpenſation of the will of God, to his Prophets or Miniſters, who as from God, diſpenſe it to his people, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 29. 18.) <hi>Where vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion faileth, the people periſh,</hi> that is, where there are none to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and declare the minde of God (no not in an ordinary way) to a people, that people are in the ready way to perdition. <hi>Without the viſions of grace, there is no ordinary way to the viſions of glory.</hi> Secondly, By a viſion, we underſtand <hi>an extraordinary work of</hi>

                     <hi>viſions,</hi> becauſe by them things were made ſo manifeſt, as if they had been ſeene before their eyes: and in ſome of theſe revelations, a viſible repreſentation was made to the eye: viſions were often attended with apparitions; In reference to both theſe ſorts of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that is appliable, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Before time in Iſrael, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he ſpake; Come let us goe to the Seer, for he that is now called a Prophet, was before time called a Seer:</hi> Prophets were called Seers, becauſe in viſions, they had either an ocular, or an intellectuall ſight of the minde of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Viſions may undergoe this diviſion: There was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen viſion, and there was a private viſion: In the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 1. we have the ground of the diſtinction, <hi>In thoſe dayes there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen viſion:</hi> Open, is oppoſed to private or ſecret; the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, a viſion appearing in publique, and the meaning of the text is this; there were no Prophets ſent openly, and (as it were) <hi>In State,</hi> inveſted with commiſſion, and furniſhed with meſſages <note place="margin">

                     </note> from Heaven unto the people; <hi>there was no open viſion:</hi> yet at that time there were private viſions, as to <hi>Manoah,</hi> Judg. 13. God revealed himſelfe in thoſe darke times, to ſome of his ſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: And ſo he hath and will at all times. While he hath a Church upon the earth, he never ſhuts himſelfe quite in Heaven. Open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may faile, but all viſions ſhall not faile. So open profeſſion may faile in the raigne of Antichriſt, in his houre, and in the power of darkneſſe; as it did in the time of <hi>Eliah,</hi> yet all profeſſion of the truth ſhall never faile: <hi>The Lord hath alwayes his thouſands in ſecret, who never bowed their knee to Baal.</hi> In many places, ſince Chriſt came in the fleſh, there hath been no open viſion, no holding forth of the truth of Chriſt, and yet even in thoſe places, there have been private viſions; and a remnant reſerved, to whom God hath made known the myſteries, of the Kingdome of Chriſt: <hi>When dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe covers all in appearance, there may be light which appeares not: and candles under a buſhell, when there are none in the Candleſticks.</hi> A <hi>Goſhen</hi> hath light, while <hi>Egypt</hi> is plagued with darkneſſe; and when the Prophets are benighted, it may be day, with many of the people.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some viſions were without any trance or raviſhment, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 15. 1.) <hi>The word of God came in a viſion to Abraham,</hi> ſpeaking to his eare, and bidding him look up to Heaven with his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40455:49"/> eyes, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. But often we finde, that viſions were accompanied with trances: 'Twas ſo with <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſe Prophet, <hi>(Num.</hi> 24. 16.) <hi>He hath ſaid, which ſaw the viſions rf the Almighty, falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a trance, but having his eyes open:</hi> And it was ſo with ſome of the true Prophets, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw a viſion, and when he heard the voice, <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was I in a deepe ſleepe upon my face, (Dan.</hi> 10. 9.) <hi>Peter</hi> was in a trance, when he had the viſion of a ſheete let downe from Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. And the Apoſtle ſaith, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1.) <hi>I will come to viſions and revelations of the Lord, whether in the body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body I cannot tell, God knoweth.</hi> His ſoule had ſo much acquaintance with God, that he became a ſtranger to his own body; his ſoule was ſo buſied in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving knowledge from God, that he was faine to put off the knowledge and care of his body, wholly to God: What the ſtate of my body was, I know not, <hi>God knoweth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some viſions were preſented only in bare naked words, others were cloathed in types and figures, in the ſhapes of beaſts of the earth, and ſoules of the ayre, of trees, and ſtones, &amp;c. As to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> in their Propheſies, and to <hi>John</hi> in the book of <hi>Revelations:</hi> Theſe figures, were as an Alphabet of ſacred Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which put together and ſpel'd, made the minde of God legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Scripture in hand, hints us a fifth difference about viſions. <hi>In thoughts from the viſions of the night,</hi> that's conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There were viſions of the day, and viſions of the night; thus it is ſaid <hi>(Dan.</hi> 2. 19.) when <hi>Daniel</hi> expounded <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> dreame, that God made it known to him <hi>in viſions of the night,</hi> oppoſing it to <hi>viſions of the day.</hi> Uſually the night was the time for viſions; hence <hi>(Numb.</hi> 22. 18, 19.) <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (when the meſſengers of <hi>Balack</hi> came to him) ſaith, <hi>Tarry this night, and I will ſhew you in the morning,</hi> he thought to have a viſion in the night: So it is obſervable, that when <hi>Saul</hi> and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, came to <hi>Samuel</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 19.) to enquire about the ſtraid Aſſes, he tells him, <hi>ye ſhall eate bread with me to day, and to morow I will let thee goe, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart;</hi> he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a night, intimating, that God uſed to reveale ſecrets unto him in the night.</p>
                  <p>So much concerning viſions, with the kindes and differences of them.</p>
                  <p>From this doctrine of viſions, we may take notice of our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40455:49"/> under the Goſpel. The Apoſtle ſaith at ſundry times and in divers manners, God ſpake unto our fathers by the Prophets, but he hath ſpoken unto us one way, which exceeds them all, <hi>Even by his Sonne who is the brightneſſe of his glory, and the expreſſe image of his perſon,</hi> Heb. 1. 2, 3. We have a viſion which outſhines all the viſions that ever the Prophets or Patriarchs had, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world. Their light was darkneſſe, at moſt but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, their viſions were obſcurities, and their revelations, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, compared with ours. Our viſion is <hi>Chriſt, God manifeſted in the fleſh; Mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation,</hi> ſaith old <hi>Simeon,</hi> he had a viſion of Chriſt in perſon. The land of <hi>Judah</hi> was call'd the <hi>valley of viſion,</hi> becauſe God revealed himſelfe to that people, more frequently and clearly, than to all the world beſide. Where ever the Goſpel is preached, that Land is <hi>a valley of viſion,</hi> a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of viſion farre more lightſome and glorious, than the land of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> was; the very darkneſſe of the Goſpel, is clearer than the light of the Law. <hi>That which was made glorious had no glory, by reaſon of that glory which excelleth,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 10. Only remember, that as our priviledge is greater than theirs, ſo is our duty; <hi>A cleare light ſhould be anſwered with a holier life.</hi> And we who have more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of what God would have done, ſhould make more conſcience to do it. Now we are not taught by dreams and viſions of the night, <hi>We ought to walk as children of the day.</hi> Not onely is darkneſſe gone, but the ſhadows are fled away. The true light now ſhines; even he who enlightens every one that comes into the warld. We need not dreams or viſions now. Why ſhould we call for Candles when the Sunne is up? We need not Starre-light when we have day-light, or when the promiſed <hi>Day-ſtarre is riſen in our hearts,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19.</p>

                     </note> elegantly, <hi>that this deepe ſleepe falleth on men;</hi> becauſe ſuch ſleepe ſeems to oppreſſe the ſpirits, as a heavie weight the body; it fals as heavie as Lead upon all a mans ſenſes, and overcomes them: we ſay ordinarily, <hi>a man fals aſleepe,</hi> and it is as true of ſleep, that it fals upon a man, and fals with ſuch a weight, that man is not able to ſtand under it. We ſay alſo, a men is heavie to ſleep, for ſleep like a heavie thing, comes down upon him, and then down comes he. Heathen Poets tell us, that at this time they had viſions, or deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rather. <hi>Satan imitates God in what he can, that he may deceive with better ſucceſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may abſerve from hence. Firſt, <hi>Seeing Eliphaz had this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion when deep ſleep falleth upon men, that the power of Gods Spirit works through all naturall impediments:</hi> when tired nature is willing to fall, or cannot ſtay it ſelfe from falling into a deep ſleep, then God can awaken us, with his viſions, and make us ſee, when we cannot hold open our eyes. When God will reveale his minde to the ſoule, he overcomes the imperfections of the body. Sleepineſſe is an imperfection; if a man be ſleepy he is unfit to hear. While the eye is thus ſhut, the eare cannot be open. That ſleeper in the <hi>Acts</hi> fell down dead, while <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching. Yet when God comes by his mighty power and Spirit, though a mans eare be ſhut, he can break through, and get into his heart. <hi>The Word hath taken ſome napping and nodding.</hi> Yea, God breaks in by his Almighty power in the revelations of his will, not only when men are in a dead naturall ſleep, but when they are in a ſleep of ſpirituall death. The Word breaks open the barres of the grave, and looſens <note place="margin">John 5. 25.</note> the bands of death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for as much as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had this viſion <hi>when deep ſleep falleth on men,</hi> himſelfe being kept awake, or waking.

                  <p>WE have already given the Logicall dependance of this whole Context, from the 12 Verſe, unto the end of the Chapter, and therein ſhewed how <hi>Eliphaz</hi> confirmes the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Propoſition (lying in the 17 Verſe) by Divine Authority, a Viſion received from Heaven. <hi>A thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly brought to me, and mine eare received a little thereof, in thoughts from viſions of the night, when deep ſleep falleth on men.</hi> Thus the manner of the viſion is deſcribed in generall. The effects of the viſion upon <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and the particular manner how the viſion appeared, are now further deſcribed and ſet forth. This 14 Verſe contains one eminent effect of the viſion, with the conſequents of it; aſſoon (ſaith he) as I was in that heavenly rapture and extaſie, <hi>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to ſhake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was very uſuall, for Prophets and Holy men, to be ſurprized with fear, at the appearance of <hi>Jehovah</hi> in his meſſages, by Angels or other viſions. It is naturall unto man to fear, at the ſight of an Angel: and it is a received opinion among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that whether God or an Angel did appear, it was preſent death, which they collect from divers Scriptures <hi>(Ex.</hi> 33. 20.) when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee the face of God, the Lord anſwered, <hi>there is no man can ſee my face and live.</hi> Thoſe words of <hi>Gideon</hi> import as much <hi>(Judg</hi> 6. 22.) <hi>When Gideon perceived that he was an Angel of the Lord, he ſaid, Alas, O Lord God, for becauſe I have ſeen an Angell of the Lord, face to face;</hi> as if he had ſaid, alas, woe is me, I ſhall certainly dye: And <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>Manoah</hi> concludes it, <hi>We ſhall ſurely dye, becauſe we have ſeene God,</hi> when an Angel appeared to them. Hence alſo <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 32. 30.) after his wraſtling with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel (which was Chriſt) called the name of the place <hi>Penuel,</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:40455:52"/> which is, <hi>The face of God,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>I have ſeen God face to face, and my life is preſerv'd;</hi> as noting, that it was a wonderfull privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not to dye at ſuch a ſight; the very appearance of God, is death to the Creature. And that which <hi>Hagar</hi> ſpake <hi>(Gen.</hi> 16 13.) may well be interpreted to this ſenſe: when flying from her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, God came to her in the Wilderneſſe, ſhe called the name of the Lord that ſpake unto her, <hi>Thou God ſeeſt me;</hi> the reaſon is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by way of admiration, for ſhe ſaid, <hi>Have I alſo here looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him that ſeeth me?</hi> Which words may well be tranſlated, <hi>Do I live after him (ſc.

                  <p>The effect of this viſion upon <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> was not death. but fear, yet no ordinary fear, but fear which looked almoſt as pale as death; it was fear joyned with trembling, and no ordinary trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, but ſuch a fit of trembling as ſhook his very bones. We have often ſpoken of fear, both in this and in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but ſuch a fear as met <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> we have not met with before.</p>
                  <p>That before was the grace of fear, ſpirituall fear, but this is the paſſion of fear, naturall fear. And it is naturall to man (as ſome of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſt homini na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turale conſpecto angelo etiam bono timere.</hi> Bold. <hi>ex</hi> Beda, Origen, <hi>&amp;</hi> Chryſoſtome.</note> the Ancients have obſerved) to fear thus at the appearance of God by Angels. <hi>Fear is cauſed by the apprehenſion of ſome evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent or at hand,</hi> that's the definition of naturall fear. Now when God manifeſts himſelf, though the greateſt good be at hand, yet the ſoul hath ſome miſgivings and apprehenſions of evil; &amp; hence comes fear: the foundation of this fear is laid in guilt, ſin is in the ſoul, and guilt may be upon the ſoul; thence naturall fear works, when God, who is all holy, manifeſts himſelf. And in ſpecial, there is much unbelief remaining in the heart, this fear is ſtrengthned by unbelief, <hi>Wherefore do ye fear,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>O ye of little faith?</hi> Where there is little faith, there is much fear; and as unbelief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, ſo fear prevails too. Thirdly, this fear ariſes from the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſſe and unexpectedneſſe of the thing. God (as you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in all thoſe Revelations of himſelf) comes ſuddenly: that which comes before we ſee it, cauſeth fear when we ſee it: ſudden motions without us, work ſtrange commotions within. And fourthly, the over-powring Majeſty and ſuper-excelling excellency of God, in any ſuch revelation, cauſeth aſtoniſhments of ſpirit: a little appearance of God, makes the creature diſappear.

                     </note> it may be, that fear and trembling took hold upon <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> like an armed man, as ſoon as the viſion appeared: <hi>fear met him</hi> (ſaith the Original) or (as the Septuagint) <hi>fear came out,</hi> and (as it were) ſtood in the way to ſurprize and apprehend him.</p>
                  <p>Neither was this bare fear, but fear heightned, fear accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trembling. Trembling of the body is a ſymptome or ſign of great fear; when fear works outwardly, manifeſting it ſelf by ſad effects upon the body, then fear is in its reign and greatneſſe. There are four ſpecial effects which fear works upon the body, &amp; we have three of them here in this Text. The firſt is, the quaking or the ſhaking of the members of the body; the ſecond is the ſhaking of the bones; the third is the ſtanding up of the hair; and the fourth is the paleneſſe and wanneſſe of the countenance. All except the laſt appeared upon <hi>Eliphaz</hi> at the appearance of this viſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he trembled in this 14 Verſe, <hi>Fear came upon me and trembling:</hi> theſe two go often together in Scripture; you ſhall find trembling coupled with godly fear, as well as with naturall fear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear</hi> (with reverentiall filiall fear) <hi>and rejoyce before him with trembling;</hi> that is, let your fear be an exceeding great fear, even ſuch, as fills you with an awfull trembling at the preſence of the Lord. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul (Phil.</hi> 2. 12.) puts them together again, <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
                  </p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40455:53"/> heart to fear, or my fleſh to tremble. <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in the third of his Propheſie, being before God in his prayer-viſions, deſcribes the rapture of his ſpirit, by this and other ſymptomes upon his body, <hi>When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voyce, rottenneſſe entred into my bones,</hi> v. 16.</p>
                  <p>The third effect followes; <hi>Then a ſpirit paſs'd before my face, and the haire of my head ſtood up. A Spirit ruſh'd upon me,</hi> ſo the Seventy. Some tranſlate it, <hi>A wind paſsd before me;</hi> a gale or breath of wind, as (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 11.) when God appeared to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> it is ſaid, firſt there came a <hi>mighty wind, which rent the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and brake the roots,</hi> and ſome conceive that a wind paſſed before <hi>Eliphaz;</hi> but the context will not bear it; thoſe words which follow are not competible with a wind; <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>It ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, it ſtood ſtill,</hi> this cannot be underſtood of the wind, for wind is alwayes in motion: and then it is ſaid, <hi>I had an Image before my face,</hi> now there is no form or Image of the wind; the wind hath no ſhape or likeneſſe, therefore it was a Spirit or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, not an Aeriall wind. And if you ſay, how hath a Spirit a form or an Image, or how can that be ſeen? I anſwer it was not a Spirit abſtracted and naked in it ſelf, but a Spirit joyned with a form and ſhape, as is generally agreed: ſo Angels or Spirits did uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the Ancients, taking a body or ſome from upon them: and thoſe apparitions, when a body was aſſumed, were called ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>(Luke</hi> 24. 37.) it is ſaid, that the Diſciples were afraid at the appearing of Chriſt, <hi>thinking they had ſeen a ſpirit:</hi> The Apoſtles were not ſo abſurd, as to believe, that a ſpirit in it ſelf, a ſpirit ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, could be ſeen; but they call'd it a ſpirit, becauſe they thought it only the repreſentation of Chriſts body, and not the true body: and therefore though an outward ſhape appear'd, they call'd it a ſpirit.

The naturall reaſon why the haire ſtands up in time of fear is this; when ſuddain fear falleth upon us, the blood goes, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſtens rather to the heart, and ſo the outward members wax cold; and the skin, in which the haire is rooted, is preſt more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which cauſeth the haire to ſtand up, though of it ſelfe it be a weak and unſtable excrement.</p>
                  <p>So we ſee the generall effect of the viſion, which was fear, and thoſe three concomitants or ſymptomes of fear, The trembling of his fleſh, The ſhaking of his bones, And the ſtanding up of the haire of his fleſh. From all, take theſe Obſervations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Foraſmuch as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> falleth into ſuch a fit of fear and amazement, at this manifeſtation of God to him, we learn, <hi>That man is not able to bear the preſence of God.</hi> Weak and fraile man, falls before the greatneſſe, power and majeſty of God. Duſt and aſhes crumbleth away, if the glory of the great God doe but ſhine forth, even in thoſe leſſer manifeſtations of himſelf. Hence it was, that <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to capitulate with God, that he would ſpeak with him, upon two Articles or conditions granted, Chap. 13. 21, 22 Firſt, <hi>Withdraw thy hand far from me.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Let not thy dread make me afraid: Then call thou, and I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; or let me ſpeake, and anſwer thou me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, ſo dreadfull is thy preſence, that unleſſe thou be pleaſed to ſweeten it to me, fear will preſently ſeize upon me, and diſable me to ſpeak. <hi>Moſes</hi> who was a <hi>favourite of heaven,</hi> and one who ſhortly after had communion with God, above all that ever lived: yet when
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40455:54"/> 
                     <hi>Jehovah</hi> appeared in that <hi>flaming Buſh,</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>That Moſes hid his face, for he was afraid to looke upen God;</hi> holy <hi>Moſes</hi> could not bear that glory. <hi>Daniel</hi> a man <hi>greatly beloved</hi> of God, and honoured with glorious viſions, was yet greatly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at thoſe viſions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 8. <hi>There remained no ſtrength in me, for my comelineſſe was turned into corruption, and I retained no ſtrength:</hi> and verſ. 16. <hi>O my lord, by the viſion my ſorrowes are turned upon me, and I have retained no ſtrength:</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>Neither is there any breath left in me.</hi> I am ready to dye, I am not able to bear thy majeſty, in theſe myſteries of thy will, made known to me. How doth <hi>Habakkuk</hi> cry out in the place afore quoted, of his trembling belly, quivering lips, and of rottenneſſe entring into his bones We find in the New Teſtament, the Saints ſwallowed up with the like amazements. <hi>Zechariah</hi> of whom the Holy Ghoſt had given ſuch an excellent teſtimony a little before, for a man that had <hi>walked blameleſſe in all the Ordinances of God,</hi> yet as ſoon as the Angel appeared, the Text ſaith, <hi>He was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Yea the bleſſed Virgin <hi>(v.</hi> 29. of that Chap.) <hi>when ſhe ſaw him</hi> (that is the Angel) <hi>ſhe was troubled in her mind.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple, ſeeing Chriſt walking in the midſt of the ſeven golden Candleſticks, <hi>&amp;c. Fell at his feet as dead,</hi> Rev. 1. 17.</p>
                  <p>How ſhould this humble and abaſe us in our ſelves! we that are not able to ſtand before the gracious manifeſtations of God, when he comes to reveale himſelf to us in mercy, how ſhall we be able to ſtand before the wrathfull manifeſtations of God? The Apoſtle tells us (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50.) <hi>Fleſh and blood cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> by <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> we are not to underſtand, the ſinfull nature of man (as fleſh and blood often ſignifie in Scripture, being oppoſed to ſpirit) but the conſtitution of nature or that eſtate wherein we ſtand, as men; this fleſh and blood is not able to enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, that is, it cannot bear the majeſty, glory and excellency of Heaven, where God clearly manifeſts himſelf unto his Saints; and where we ſhall <hi>ſee God face to face;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle argueth all along, as by divers other Arguments, ſo by this; to prove the neceſſity of a reſurrection, a raiſing and a new moulding of the body, into a ſpirituall condition: Why, becauſe our naturall bodies are not able to ſtand under ſuch a weight of glory, as is prepared for the Saints in that Kingdome: <hi>Corruption</hi> (nature ſubject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40455:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> cannot inherit incorruption; hence it was, that when but a little of God broke forth, the holieſt and beſt of men in the world, fell a ſhaking and trembling, as not being able to beare, that tranſcendent majeſty, ſhiningout in thoſe weaker refracted beames of glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing God comming at this time to inſtruct <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz,</hi> and reveale a great truth to him, was pleaſed to deale thus with him, to make him ſhake and tremble, we may note, <hi>That God uſually humbles a man, and layes him very low, before he exalts him in the manifeſtations of his truth or power. Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions prepare and poſture the heart for revelations.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe God delights to have a man humbled, before he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. <hi>Paul</hi> (though as humble a ſoule as lived) was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be <hi>exalted above meaſure, through the aboundance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> (2 Gor 12.) Even divine knowledge (through our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) is apt to puffe up, and therefore we had need to have the bladder prickt, and our ſpirits laid flat, for the receiving of know ledge: <hi>Onely humble ones are fit to be Gods ſchollars;</hi> he will teach none elſe, he reſiſteth a proud man, then ſurely he will never teach a proud man; <hi>The mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>od made that moſt memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manifeſtation of himſelfe, to the ancient Church, in giving the Law; we reade how he terrified them, how he humbled and abaſed them: How dreadfull was the preparation to the giving of the Law? The Apoſtle deſcribes it, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 12. 18, 20, 21.) by <hi>blackneſſe, and darkneſſe, and tempeſt, ſo that they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that which was commanded; and ſo terrible was the ſight, that</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, I exceedingly feare and quake;</hi> I confeſſe the Law in it ſelfe, was a terrible, a <hi>killing letter,</hi> and that, which might well make the world ſhake, and men to tremble: <hi>If</hi> (as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſaith) <hi>but one precept or ſentence of the Law ſhould be left in its full power and ſtrength (mans ſinne) it would deſtroy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and make all the world (becauſe guilty) tremble and fall before it;</hi> yet it was not barely the matter of the Law revealed, which cauſed this trembling: that was written in the heart o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40455:55"/> Goſpell intentions; but it was the manner and circumſtances wherein the Law was revealed, which were ſo terrible. And this terror had this great uſe, even the humbling of their ſoules to a willing ſubjection and obedience to the will of God. When God revealed the Goſpell to <hi>Paul</hi> (as well as when he revealed the Law to <hi>Moſes,)</hi> he made <hi>Paul</hi> tremble <hi>(Act.</hi> 9.) <hi>Paul</hi> was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down to the ground, God layed him along, unhors'd him, when he came to manifeſt his Chriſt to, or (as himſelfe ſpeaks, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 1. 16.) <hi>to reveale his Son in him:</hi> And this was to abaſe him, <hi>to breake his heart,</hi> that he might be made up <hi>a choſen veſſel, to carry the Name of God unto the Gentiles.</hi> And howſoever ſuch <note place="margin">Acts 9. 15.</note> humiliations are not of abſolute neceſſity, yet they have been very uſuall, and very uſefull. When the Lord hath layd the will and wiſdome of man in the duſt, when he hath made the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and ſtouteſt to become as a childe or a babe, to quake before him; then he takes him into his Schoole of Inſtruction, and ſhewes him ſuch things, <hi>as none of the wiſe men, or Princes of this world ever knew, even ſuch things, as eye hath not ſeen, eare hath not heard, neither have they entred into the heart of man.</hi> This made our Lord Jeſus break out into that mixt rapture of gratulation and admiration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>I thanke thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and haſt revealed them to babes.</hi> Be as babes before God, and he will give you the wiſedome of men, yea of Angels.

                  <p>Thirdly, From this effect of the viſion, obſerve, <hi>That feare, is a ſtrong and powerfull paſſion.</hi> Feare comes upon a man like a Giant, <hi>Feare</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz) came upon me,</hi> it came upon me violently. A man were as good meete a beare rob'd of her whelps, as this feare: The ſtrongeſt man in the world, cannot ſhake your bones, as feare alone will, if that take hold of you. Some of the Greeks, had ſuch amazing thoughts of Feare, it was ſo terrible to them, that to appeaſe it, they worſhipped it for a god, as ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped <hi>ſorrow</hi> among the <hi>Romanes</hi> for a goddeſſe, under the name of <hi>Dea Angerona. The true God is called feare</hi> in Scripture: And <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug de Civ. Dei. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> feare was made an Idol God among the <hi>Heathens:</hi> And if we conſider theſe effects in the Text, <hi>trembling of the fleſh, ſhaking of the bones, ſtanding up of the haire,</hi> all which this ſuddaine ſurpriſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40455:55"/> of feare wrought upon <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> we muſt needs acknowledge and conclude it to be, a very potent paſſion. In the firſt of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> the Lord threatens thoſe who would not feare him, thus, <hi>I will</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>laugh when your feare commeth:</hi> Then he ſhewes the manner how ſuch feare commeth, <hi>When your feare commeth as deſolation.</hi> We cannot well take feare in this place, for the object of feare, for that is deſolation it ſelfe, and therefore cannot be ſaid, <hi>to come as deſolation.</hi> Then, taking it properly, for the paſſion of fear: We ſee, that the feare of trouble, is like the trouble we feare. Feare is even as bad as deſolation; Feare puls all downe within, and makes a man like a deſolate place, before his place is made deſolate. And therefore in theſe times, we had need take care, that we put not ſtrength to our feares. Theſe are fearing times, we ſhould pray much, that the power of naturall feare may be ſubdued, eſpecially that our naturall feare, may be turned into godly feare; godly feare, is the proper cure of naturall feare: <hi>Sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and make him your feare,</hi> or elſe the feare of man will quickly Lord it over your hearts. Such a feare, is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, then all our dangers: Our enemies ſhall need no weapons to fight againſt us, with, but our own feares. Trembling joints, and ſhaking bones, will make ſmall reſiſtance; and while naturall feare is ſtrong, naturall ſtrength is, but weake or uſeleſſe; <hi>When from the onſet or aſſault of this feare, a mans haire ſtands, himſelfe will run.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider this by way of conſequence, That if a time when God commeth to reveale his will to man, be ſo dreadfull, what will that time be (and that time is comming) when God commeth to reckon with man, for the diſobeying of that will? Here a truth was but ſhewed <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and behold him ſhaking, fearing, trembling; Now when God ſhall come to require an account of man, for reſiſting or impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth; when he ſhall come (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8.) <hi>to take vengeance on all thoſe that have not obeyed the Goſpell of truth,</hi> what terror, fear and trembling will fall upon the ſtouteſt of ſinfull men? There muſt be an appearing of all, but there can be no ſtanding for ſuch, before the dreadfull throne of Chriſt: <hi>The ungodly</hi> (of vvhat ſort of ſize ſoever) <hi>ſhall not ſtand in judgement,</hi> Pſal. 1. 5. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent unbeleevers, ſhall not be able to hold up their heads in that day. Captaines and mighty men, who have often converſed vvith dangers, and knew not what it was to be afraid; Men
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40455:56"/> who (like the Horſe, deſcribed, <hi>Job</hi> 39. 22.) <hi>uſed to mock at feare, and would not turne backe for drawne ſwords, or the glittering of ſhield or ſpeare,</hi> ſhall at that day ſhake with feare, and hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like little children. So much for the effects of the viſion. Now follows a further deſcription of the viſion.</p>
                  <q>Verſe 16. <hi>It ſtood ſtill, but I could not diſcerne the forme thereof, an image was before mine eyes, there was ſilence, and I heard a voice, ſaying.</hi>

                  <p>This verſe containeth a ſecond geſture of this ſpirits appearing in the viſion to <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> The ſpirit was <hi>paſſing</hi> before, here <hi>ſtanding,</hi> as if he would preſent himſelfe more fully to his view and obſervation. <hi>It ſtood ſtill, an image was before mine eyes;</hi> but though the ſpirit gave <hi>Eliphaz</hi> this faire advantage, yet he made little uſe of it, for he ſaith, <hi>I could not diſcerne the forme of it,</hi> that is, I could make nothing of it directly; But when his eye gave him no helpe, his eare did: though he could not diſcerne or diſtinguiſh the forme of the ſpirit appearing, yet he could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the voice of the ſpirit ſpeaking, <hi>there was ſilence, and I heard a voice ſaying.</hi>

                     <hi>It ſtood ſtill.]</hi> To ſtand, in Scripture, imports not alwayes a ſetled poſture of the body: but it is taken ſometime in a larger ſenſe, to note our preſence in any place, whether it be ſitting, ſtanding or walking, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 28. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>There be ſome ſtanding here, which ſhall not taſte of death, till they ſee the Sonne of man comming in his Kingdome.</hi> Yet here the poſture is conceived to be, an erect, ſetled, fixed poſture; to the intent, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> might have his eye more ſetled and fixed upon it, and likewiſe that his heart might be better prepared and fitted, for the receiving of that meſſage, which ſhould be delivered unto him by it; when a man ſpeakes, he uſually makes a ſtand; <hi>An ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory ſpeech,</hi> a ſpeech in motion, is not ſo audible, nor ſo comely. In apparitions, this poſture is frequently mentioned. When our Lord appeared to the Diſciples after the reſurrection, <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſtood amengst them,</hi> cap. 24. 36. <hi>Zacharie, ſaw the Angel ſtanding on the right ſide of the Altar,</hi> Luk. 1. 11.

The impreſſions of glory and immortality, which appeare upon bodies aſſumed by ſpirits, eſpecially in ſudden apparitions, doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly maſter, if not aſtoniſh ſenſe. The Heathens thought it abſurd to ſay, that their Gods could be known by face: For though they were ſo groſſe, as to ſatisfie rhemſelves with bodily Gods, yet they believed thoſe bodies were ſo refined, had ſuch a kinde of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick Divinity ſtampt upon them, that a meer mortall could not comprehend them. Their doctrine ſhines a little into this Text. A ſpirit paſſed before <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> he had a ſight of it, for it ſtood ſtill, yet he could not make out what it was, or who it was, <hi>he could not diſcerne the form thereof.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>A twofold reaſon may be given why the Lord ſpake (as it were) in ſilence. Firſt, that the ſecret manner of ſpeaking might be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the matter ſpoken was a ſecret, a myſtery, not common or ordinary. Secondly, to diſpoſe the hearer to receive it with more care, reverence, and attention. <hi>A man muſt ſet himſelfe to heare with diligence, while another ſpeaks with ſilence.</hi> A loud voice findes us out, comes to us: but we muſt come to a low voice, and finde that out. When the Speaker takes leaſt pains with his tongue, the hearer muſt take moſt pains with his eare.</p>
                  <p>And this manner of ſpeaking, was uſed by the ancient Heathen in their <hi>myſterious Oracles and Revelations.</hi> As when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed a ſecret, he ſpake ſecretly, and as it were whiſpered thoſe truths in the eare; whiſpering is ſpeaking within one degree of ſilence) ſo the Devill (who imitates God in what he can, that he may draw credit unto his own deceivings) is deſcribed in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to ſpeak thus. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 19. <hi>When they ſhall ſay unto you, ſeek unto them that have familiar ſpirits, and unto Wizards, that peep and that mutter;</hi> they ſpeak as it were ſilently, they onely whiſper their diabolicall incantations, and lying impoſtures. And <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 29.) <hi>Thou ſhalt be brought down and ſhalt ſpeak out of the ground, and thy ſpeech ſhall be low out of the duſt, and thy voice ſhall be as of one that hath a familiar Spirit out of the ground, and thy ſpeech ſhall whiſper out of the dust.</hi> The Prophet in this alludes to the manner of Witches and Inchanters, who had familiar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which he here applyes in a threat unto the people: the time ſhall come that you ſhall be brought down by your enemies, that you ſhall ſpeak out of the ground, you ſhall lye at their feet like poore captives, that cry ſubmiſſively and pitifully for quarter, <hi>O mercy, mercy, ſpare my life;</hi> that's the thing aimed at by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that God would abaſe them ſo, before their enemies, that they ſhould whiſper out of the ground to their enemies for pity, as a Witch whiſpers from the ground to her miſerable Clients who come for counſel. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Apologetick</hi> deſcribes the heathen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians</hi>

In Congregations before the Preacher begins, all hold their peace; In Courts of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice when the Judge is to ſpeak, the Crier cals for ſilence: It was a uſuall word amongſt the rites of the Heathen, <hi>Favour your tongues, or ſpare your ſpeech,</hi> when the myſteries of their ſuperſtition were <note place="margin">Favete linguis.</note> revealed: we may take the preſent Text in this ſenſe: that <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> ſet himſelfe in a ſilent poſture to attend the meſſage which was to be revealed unto him. <hi>There was ſilence and I heard a voice, ſaying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we take the former interpretation, then, for as much as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> after thoſe terrours and tremblings, the ſhaking of his bones, and ſtanding up of his haire, the confuſed form of a ſpirit, and an amazing Image before his eyes: for as much (I ſay) as after all theſe, he hears <hi>a ſtill ſilent voice.</hi> We may obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God after terrours uſually ſends in comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings.</hi> God having terrified <hi>Elijah</hi> by a mighty ruſhing winde (in the viſion before noted) by an Earthquake which brake the Rocks, and by a fire: then comes (as here in the Text) <hi>a ſtill ſmall voice,</hi> a voice of ſilence, <hi>and God was in that voice.</hi> It is put as a principall diſtinction amongſt the Ancients, to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40455:58"/> know, whether a revelation were from a good Angel or from a bad Angel. When a revelation was made by a good Angel, though he fill'd the heart with fear, at the beginning of his ſpeech, yet he gave comfort in the end, and cloſed with in conſolation. We may obſerve in thoſe revelations ſuch heartning, chearing language as this, <hi>Be not afraid, be of good chear;</hi> ſo to <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſo to <hi>John,</hi> ſo to <hi>Zechariah,</hi> ſo to <hi>Mary,</hi> ſo to <hi>Gideon.</hi> But when a revelation was made by an evill Angel, or by a Witch, as it filled the hearers with feare, ſo it left them full of feare, it wounded them with terrours, and it applyed no cure, no playſter, nothing medicinable to heale thoſe terrours. We finde, indeed, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28) that when <hi>Saul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> as ſoon as the Spirit appeared, it is ſaid, that the Witch her ſelfe was afraid, and there is no mention made of <hi>Sauls</hi> being afraid, at the firſt; ſo that <hi>Saul</hi> fals a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the Witch, and ſaid to her, <hi>be not afraid:</hi> She was afraid, not of the Spirit that appeared, but of <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe he had made a law againſt Witches; and hence <hi>Saul</hi> comforts her, in aſſurance of impunity, notwithſtanding that ſinne, both againſt the law of God, and his own. But you ſhall finde in how ſad a condition <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe was, before the Devill had done with him; for, as ſoon as <hi>Saul</hi> heard the tydings delivered by that <hi>perſonated Samuel,</hi> he fell into a ſhaking fit, and was as one aſtoniſhed and dead: hanging upon the rack of theſe torments, the Devill left him; there was no word of comfort, no ſweet ſtill muſicall voice to revive and fetch him againe, but away packs the wicked Spirit, and leaves him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with ſorrow. And then (inſtead of a better, ſurely he could not have a worſe) the poor Witch comes to comfort and counſell him. <hi>They who refuſe counſell from the Prophets of God may at laſt be forced to receive all their comfort from a Witch, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or Propheteſſe of the Devill.</hi> But to the point in hand, we ſee when the Devill and wicked Angels ſpeake terrour, they leave ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: Whereas if God, by good Angels ſpeaks terrour, or affrights his people with the tokens of his preſence, he with a ſweet and ſtill voice refreſhes and comforts them, before he departs.</p>
                  <p>And we may in that generall apply it to our ſelves. That when God aſtoniſhes and terrifies us, when he makes our bones to ſhake, and rottenneſſe to enter into them, wee may expect comfort and refreſhing are at hand; and we may build upon it, that the more we tremble, the more we ſhall be refreſhed; <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in the place before cited, is expreſſe in this faith, <hi>I trembled, that I</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:40455:59"/> 
                     <hi>might have reſt in the day of trouble;</hi> to which he addes, <hi>when he commeth up to the people (he will invade or cut them to pieces) with his troopes.</hi> As intimating, that they who will not tremble, ſhall be made to tremble; but when we actively labour to make our hearts tremble, or when God makes us tremble in ſuch a way as this, we may build upon it, that, we ſhall reſt in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at leaſt we ſhall reſt in the end of that day: God never leaves his people under a Cloud: he takes off trouble, and brings in a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of comfort, or conquers the trouble by mingling a prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling portion of comfort with it.</p>
                  <p>If we take the Text in the latter ſenſe, we may note, <hi>That ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence becomes man when God ſpeaks. Speak Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Samuel) for thy ſervant heareth.</hi> Heare O ſervant, for thy Lord ſpeaketh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Silence prepares the heart to learne: Pythagoras</hi> commanded his Scholers to keep ſilence five yeares. And the Papiſts impoſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as a part of diſcipline upon their Novices. Let ſuperſtition be avoided, and then <hi>Silence is fittest for learners, unleſſe their voyce be an enquiry after learning.</hi> That which the Apoſtle ſpeaks reſpecting women in the Church, is true of all in the ſenſe I now ſpeak of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Let the woman learn in ſilence,</hi> ſo let the man learn in ſilence. There were many among us, not long ſince, who made many <hi>teachers ſilent. Silence is good as it is a preparative to learning, but woe to that, which is a hinderance to inſtructing.</hi> They enjoyned ſilence on Teachers, by which knowledge was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: we advice ſilence upon learners, that knowledge may be encreaſed.</p>

                     </note> from reaſon, in the following part of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall mortall man be more juſt than God?</hi> or, <hi>Shall man be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in compariſon of God?</hi> or, <hi>Shall man be juſt before God?</hi> The Chaldee Paraphraſe is yet more quick: The Spirit cryed out and ſaid, <hi>Can it poſſibly be, that man ſhould be more pure than God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are propounded by way of queſtion, we may reſolve them into this negative propoſition, <hi>Mortall man is not more juſt than God, man is not more pure than his Maker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We tranſlate <hi>Mortall man,</hi> the Hebrew is but one word, yet in the propriety of that language, it contains both, noting man with an addition (ſuch as it is) of weakneſſe and frailty, the meaneſt and loweſt eſtate of man: <hi>Enoſh,</hi> a poor, ſick, weak, dying creature, a creature of ſo little hope, that ſome derive this name in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, from deſperation; a creature ſo unworthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by God, or ſo ready to forget God, that others derive it from a word, which ſignifies forgetfulneſſe, or to forget.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall man, this mortall man,</hi> this weake creature, be <hi>more juſt,</hi> or <hi>be juſtified rather than God?</hi> Such a ſenſe the words carry. When man and God are compared together, ſhall God be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med leſſe juſt, or leſſe pure than man? <hi>(Luk.</hi> 18. 14.) it is ſaid of the <hi>Publican, that he went downe juſtified, rather than the other;</hi> put the Phariſee and the Publican in the ballance together, and the Publican was the weightier in righteouſneſſe, or the more juſt of the two: That in <hi>Luke,</hi> is an <hi>Hebraiſme,</hi> and it is the ſame with this. Put weak man and the mighty God (the word <hi>Eloha,</hi> which is here uſed for God, noteth the ſtrong God, or the mighty God) put him in the ballance of conſideration with weake man, will he not be infinitely more weighty in juſtice, more ſhining in purity, more glorious in holineſſe?</p>
                  <p>Yea, not only if you take man in his obſcureſt notion, or in this terme of extenuation, <hi>Enoſh,</hi> for a weake man, a poore creepled creeping creature; but take him in his beſt eſtate, as he is <hi>(Geber)</hi> a ſtrong man, a powerfull man, a holy man: yet as it followes in the text, <hi>ſhall man be more pure than his Maker?</hi> that is, ſhall ſuch a mighty man, a wiſe man, a learned man, a gracious man, a man accompliſhed in all naturall, in all acquired endowments, the chiefeſt and choiſeſt, the creame and flower of all the men upon the face of the earth; A Worthy of the firſt three, the Firſt of all the Worthies; A man of the firſt magnitude, of the higheſt eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40455:60"/> both in parts, gifts and graces, <hi>ſhall he be more pure than his Maker?</hi> Chriſt (as incarnate or made man) is called, <hi>the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God,</hi> (Iſa. 9. 6.) <hi>God made a Mighty man, or man becomming the Mighty God.</hi> The Chaldee calls all Giants, <hi>Gibbaraja;</hi> and <hi>Nimrod</hi> the firſt of the Giants, was called by this name, a Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hunter before the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 8. So then, Let man be never ſo excellent, his excellency is baſeneſſe; let him be never ſo ſtrong, ſo wiſe, ſo holy, he is but weake, fooliſh, filthy, compared with him who made him. Leave your <hi>Enoſh,</hi> your weakeling, your poore ſick creatures: bring forth your <hi>Gibers,</hi> your beſt, they are as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yea leſſe than nothing before the Lord. <hi>Shall mortall man be more juſt than God? ſhall man (the beſt of men) be more pure than his Maker?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are to marke the double oppoſition of the Text. Here is firſt, mortall, weake, ſick man, ſet in oppoſition to the ſtrong, the mighty, the all-powerfull God. And then in the ſecond place, the oppoſition is between the ſtrongeſt, the beſt, the holieſt, the wiſeſt of men, and the maker of all men. <hi>Shall mortall man, or ſhall the best of men be more juſt, more pure than God their Maker?</hi> There is a three-fold ſenſe, which we may give of the words joyntly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are a deniall of all compariſon between God and man. No man may compare himſelfe with God. <hi>Shall mortall man?</hi> that is, mortall man ought not to be ſo bold, and daring as to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon ſuch a thing as this, to ſtand upon termes of equality with the mighty, the great, the glorious God, the Maker of all, as the Apoſtle reſolves in his own caſe, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.) <hi>Though I know nothing by my ſelfe, yet am I not hereby juſtified at all,</hi> much leſſe though a man know nothing by himſelfe, will this juſtifie him in this compariſon, <hi>that he is juſt, as God is juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, <hi>Shall mortall man be more juſt than God?</hi> It is as if he had ſaid, God who is infinite in juſtice, would never doe that which a juſt man will not doe; God who is infinite in power, would never doe that, which a weake man would not doe, <hi>ſhall weake man be more juſt than God?</hi> And ſo we may forme the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No man, no Judge, is more juſt or incorrupt than God, who is the ſupreame and Lord chiefe Juſtice of all men. But there is no juſt Judge amongst men, who will puniſh an innocent man: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth not puniſh any one that is innocent.</hi> The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40455:60"/> or inference is plaine and cleare, for God himſelfe ſhould either be unjuſt, or he ſhould be leſſe juſt, than man is, if he ſhould doe that, which a juſt man upon true grounds would refuſe to doe. Therefore in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Abraham</hi> pleades with God, under that title of a juſt Judge, <hi>ſhall not the Judge of all the world doe right?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, faithfull Judges upon the earth, will doe right, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely he that is the Judge of all the earth will doe right; ſo <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here to <hi>Job,</hi> Never complaine as if God had done thee wrong, for certainly, the juſt God will not doe that which a juſt man would not doe: The word, whereby God is expreſt <hi>(Eloha)</hi>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40455:61"/> and rightly principled, <hi>Such a man ſhall ſay, verily there is a God that judgeth the earth.</hi> In the judgement of man, that judgment ſhall ſpeak a God; and all ſhall be forced to <hi>Daniels</hi> mourning acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, <hi>O Lord righteouſneſſe belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of face.</hi> Dan. 97. 9 We may enlighten it further by that of <hi>David</hi> (Pſ. 51. 4.) where he profeſſes thus, <hi>I will confeſſe my ſins, &amp;c. that thou maieſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and be cleare when thou judgeſt:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if hereafter thou ſhalt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me, and lay thy rod upon me, I know many will be ready to complaine and ſay, why doth God thus, why doth he afflict <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, David</hi> a holy man, a man after his own heart: a man of whom he hath given ſuch large teſtimony, of whom he hath ſaid, I have found <hi>a man after my own heart.</hi> Now to the intent all theſe may be caſt in their ſuits, and anſwered in their complainings, I here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge before all the world, that I have ſinned greatly; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though thou haſt pardoned my ſinne, and ſo wilt never charge it upon me to condemnation, nor puniſh me for it in a way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; yet hereafter thou maieſt in thy fatherly wiſdome, ſee it needfull to chaſtiſe me, to prevent and purge out ſin, or to help me againſt the weakneſſe of my nature, and the ſtrength of temptation for the time to come. So here in the Text, <hi>Shall man be juſtified before God?</hi> If <hi>Job</hi> or any of his friends for him, ſhould complaine againſt God, why he being one commended and approved from the mouth of God, for a man <hi>perfect and upright,</hi> ſhould be thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; what? <hi>Shall weake Job be juſtified before God?</hi> Yea, though <hi>Job</hi> be conſidered in his greeneſt flouriſhings of grace, and higheſt pitch of his proſperity, as he was <hi>Geber</hi> indeed, <hi>the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, the mightieſt man in the Eaſterne world; yet ſhall he be more pure than his Maker?</hi> No, ceaſe your complainings, God is juſt, and his honour muſt be vindicated, in what he doth, or in what he ſhall doe againſt the weakeſt, or againſt the mightieſt, againſt the meaneſt or againſt the beſt of men. <hi>God will be found juſt, and man a lyar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Either of theſe three ſenſes are faire from the conſtruction of the Text, and may be profitable for us; I ſhall therefore draw them down into five or ſix concluſions, which will be at leaſt a portion of that marrow and fatneſſe which this Scripture yeilds us to feed upon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we may obſerve, <hi>That man naturally preferreth himſelfe</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:40455:61"/> 
                     <hi>not onely above other men, but even before God himſelfe.</hi> A <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of pride dwels in our hearts by nature, which at ſome times, and in ſome caſes breeds better thoughts in us of our ſelves, than of God himſelfe. And it is this height of ſpirit, which the heavenly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion here would levell to the ground. We know it was the firſt ſin of man, that man deſired to be like God <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. The firſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was baited with a parity to the Divine powers, <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods knowing good and evill.</hi> This alſo was the language of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers heart; Thou haſt ſaid in thy heart, I will aſcend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the ſtarres of God, I will aſcend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the heights of the Clouds, I will be like the moſt high,</hi> I ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>4. 13, 14. And the practiſe of <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> is thus propheſied <hi>That he ſhall exalt himſelfe, above all that is called God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 4. But the heart of man is yet more mad, and hath out-growne thoſe ſinfull principles. For in troubles and temptations, when things go not according to his minde, he ſometimes hath thoughts not only that he is like God: but that he is more juſt than God, and if he had the ordering of things, he would order them better than God: he ſometime thinks himſelfe juſter than God, and if he had the puniſhing of offenders, juſtice ſhould proceed more freely and impartially than it doth: which is upon the matter, not onely to exalt himſelf (as the Man of Sin doth) above <hi>Nuncupative Gods,</hi> or all <hi>that is called God,</hi> but to exalt himſelf above him <hi>who is God by nature, above the onely one-moſt God.</hi> Even to ſpeak in this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of higheſt blaſphemy, that he is <hi>more juſt than God, more pure than his Maker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take this concluſion, <hi>That it is a moſt high preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not onely for low weak man, but for the beſt, the higheſt of men, to compare themſelves with God, or to have any thoughts concerning his wayes, as if they could mend them.</hi> When God cals us to amend our wayes, for us to preſume we could amend Gods wayes, is the very top branch, the higheſt tower, yea, the moſt towring Pinnacle of preſumption. We ſay amongſt men, that <hi>compariſons are odious;</hi> but this is the moſt odious compariſon of all, for a man to compare himſelfe with God, <hi>his thoughts with Gods thoughts,</hi> what he hath done or would doe, with what God doth.</p>
                  <p>If you conſider the termes of oppoſition that are in the Text, this concluſion will be more clear unto you. Conſider how <hi>Enoſh,</hi> weak mortall man is oppoſite to <hi>Elohah,</hi> the mighty, the ſtrong God; it is preſumption for a weak man to compare with a ſtrong
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40455:62"/> man; what preſumption is it then, for a weake man to compare with the mighty God? for a reed to compare in ſtrength with a rock? for darkneſſe to compare with light? for a cloud to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the Sunne? for death to compare with life? for folly to compare with wiſdome? for uncleaneneſſe to compare with holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? for nothing to compare with All, how preſuptuous? <hi>Will ye provoke the Lord:</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) <hi>are ye ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he?</hi> It implies, that ſome ſuch thoughts lodge in man, as if he could make his partie good, with God, or might be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he. And it is equall folly in us, and provocation againſt the Lord, to thinke our ſelves juſter, as to thinke our ſelves ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he.</p>
                  <p>And then marke the other termes of oppoſition; <hi>Man and his Maker: Shall the great man, compare with,</hi> or be <hi>more pure than his Maker?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, How great and excellent ſoever this man is, he was made, and made by God, with whom he thus compares, than whom he thinks himſelfe more pure. And ſhall the thing formed, ſtand upon termes with him that formed it? ſhall the potſheard or the pot, contend with the Potter? what though it be an excellent veſſell; a veſſell determined for the moſt excellent ends and uſes? yet whatſoever it is, it was made to be, and made to be by God, both in its conſtitution and uſes. Shall it then boaſt it ſelfe againſt its maker? The Lord made <hi>Geber</hi> as well as <hi>Enoſh,</hi> the ſtrong man, as well as the weake, the wiſe and learned man, as well as the fooliſh and ignorant, the Noble as well as the baſe, the holy and righteous, as well as the wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; In a word, <hi>the veſſels of honour are as much, yea more of his making</hi> than the veſſels of diſhonour, ſhall they then <hi>be more pure than their Maker?</hi> hath the Lord given more to others, than he hath in himſelfe? hath he made a creature his ſuperior, or his Peere? hath his bounty impaired his own ſtock, or hath he made man, more than God? That God hath made the beſt out of the duſt, is enough to lay all our pride and boaſting as low as the duſt. That, what we are, we are from another, ſhould ever keep us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Take this Concluſion, That <hi>God in himſelfe is moſt juſt and pure. Shall mortall man be more juſt than God?</hi> The queſtion hath this poſition in it, that God is infinitely juſt, infinite<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly pure, therefore he is perfectly pure, perfectly juſt. God is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Juſtice, eſſentiall purity; Juſtice and purity are not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40455:62"/> in God, but they are his very nature; A man, may be a man and yet be unjuſt, but God cannot be God and be unjuſt; A man, may be a man and yet impure, but God cannot be God and be impure, ſo that Juſtice and purity are not qualities or accidents in God, but his very eſſence and <hi>being;</hi> deſtroy or deny the purity and Juſtice of God, and you put God out of the world, as much as in you lies: for he cannot be God, unleſſe he be both juſt to others, and pure in himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Take this concluſion, <hi>The beſt men compared with God are evill, and the holieſt are impure.</hi> Not onely is it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption but a lye, for men to compare with God; <hi>ſhall mortall man be more juſt than God?</hi> It is as if he ſhould ſay, man hath no Juſtice at all compared with God, <hi>ſhall man be more pure than his Maker?</hi> Man compared with his Maker, hath no purity at all, not ſo much as a name or a ſhadow of Juſtice, and purity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with God: though it be ſomewhat in it ſelfe, yet it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before him: <hi>In thy ſight, or before thee, ſhall no fleſh living be justified, or be juſt.</hi> All that righteouſneſſe and purity, which God hath put into the creature, is but as the light of a candle, to the light <note place="margin">

                  <p>The fifth Concluſion is this, and it is the principall point which we are to receive and attend from this Text. <hi>God is ſo juſt, ſo pure in himſelfe, that he nether doth, nor can doe wrong to any creature:</hi> In this truth, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> aimes to inſtruct <hi>Job</hi> chiefely; for he ſuppoſed, that <hi>Job</hi> had complained of God, as if he had done him wrong, wherefore he ſpeakes reprovingly and chidingly, <hi>ſhall mortall man be more juſt than God?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, art thou ſo groſſe as to charge God with doing thee an injury? It is impoſſible that God ſhould doe any man wrong? <hi>(de Facto)</hi> he doth no man wrong, and, <hi>(de Poſſe)</hi> he cannot wrong any man. <hi>The power of God is ſeene moſt in this, that he cannot doe any evill; This impotencie</hi> (if we may ſo call it) <hi>is the ſtrength of God; yea the omnipotency of God conſiſts in this, that he can doe no wrong.</hi> We have a <hi>Maxime</hi> of ſtate amongſt us, (and it is the glory of the Kings of this Nation) we ſay, <hi>The King can doe no wrong;</hi> but it is not to be underſtood as this, <hi>God can doe no wrong;</hi> we know Kings are men, and that's enough to prove they may doe wrong: As to ſay, the Lord is God, is enough to prove, that he cannot. Princes have a <hi>naturall power</hi> to doe evill, but (which is his glory) God hath not. The meaning then is, the King hath not any <hi>civill power</hi> to doe wrong; the Law hath ſo bounded, ordered and directed him; The conſtitution of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath given him the advice of Parliaments and Counſellours, the aſſiſtance of Judges and Officers, he acts by others: ſo that <hi>The failings of his Miniſters doe the ſubject wrong, the regall power doth it not.</hi> But when we ſpeake thus of God, we meane it of his naturall power, which being eſſentially and infinitely juſt and good, as well as ſoveraigne and ſupreme, there is not the leaſt imaginable ſeed in him, which ſhould be procreative of the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice: Therefore the Scripture deſcribes the Lord, juſt and holy, not only in his nature, but in all his works and wayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works.</hi> And this implyes, not onely that all the wayes, wherein the Lord walks, are righteous, and the works he doth, <hi>holy:</hi> but that he can goe in no way but a righteous way, nor doe any worke in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a worke of holineſſe. <hi>Not onely is that juſt and holy, which</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:40455:63"/> 
                     <hi>the Lord doth, but let the Lord doe what he will, that will be juſt and holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here give me leave, ſomewhat to enlarge this, and plead for God againſt ſome objections, which are made by the men of the world, and ſome temptations which Satan will urge ſtrongly upon the hearts of thoſe, who feare God; by which (poſſibly) they may be ſo entangled and gravel'd, that they know not how to extricate themſelves, or make out the juſtice of God, in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations towards men.</p>
                  <p>For firſt it will be objected, Is God ſo juſt, that he neither doth nor can doe injuſtice to the creature? How comes it to paſſe, that both the righteous and the wicked, fall under the ſame judgement: if the judgement be right upon a wicked man, ſurely it cannot be right upon the righteous man; Is God righteous and juſt, when they who differ as much as Heaven and Hell, as light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doe yet meete (as it were) under the ſame act of God, and are wrapt together in the ſame ſentence? If it be Juſtice upon the wicked, if it be their portion, how can it be the portion of the righteous, or an award of Juſtice upon them? As <hi>Abraham</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 18. 25.) <hi>Shall the righteous be ſlaine or periſh with the wicked? that be farre from thee to doe in this manner, ſhall not the Judge of all the earth doe right?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if thou doeſt involve a juſt man, and a wicked man in one and the ſame judgement, this is not to doe as a righteous Judge, farre be it from thee to doe ſuch a thing. Yet we ſee in frequent experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the ſame judgement falleth upon the righteous and the wicked; By ſword, famine, peſtilence, by ſtormes at Sea and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Land, both are overtaken and fall together. Is this uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Juſtice?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Juſtiee is to give every one his portion,</hi> his due. And God hath <note place="margin">Juſtitia eſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um cui<expan>

                  <p>I anſwer it firſt in the generall, and then in ſome particulars. In the generall, the troubles of the righteous are good for them,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40455:64"/> and therefore they have that which is promiſed; God ſaith, <hi>ſay to the righteous it ſhall be well with him:</hi> when a righteous man is troubled, it is vvell with him; therefore he hath that, which God promiſeth him; and when a wicked man proſpereth, it is ill with him, therefore he hath that, vvhich God thratneth againſt him. Outward mercy is judgement to wicked men, and their proſperity is their undoing: therefore, do not think that God varies a tittle from the tenour of his word, when he ſaith, it ſhall be ill with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and yet you ſee them proſper; for it is never worſe with them, then when they proſper, then when they think it is beſt, and when the world thinks ſo too; <hi>the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>them;</hi> and what proſperity is there in deſtruction? <hi>The meat in their mouthes, is as a ſword in their bowels.</hi> If you ſaw the Lord formally ſending a Sword to devoure wicked men, you would think it juſtice: the proſperity of wicked men is as ſharpe as a Sword, that can but deſtroy, and ſo doth this; <hi>It is their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they are without judgements, and not to be ſmitten is their ſcourge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now more particularly to anſwer this objection about the juſtice of God. And it will be but needfull, conſidering the times we live in, threaten us with a common deluge, or an overflowing ſcourge, vvhich may ſweep away both good and bad together.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in reference to the godly. Are they in a ſad eſtate out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly? are they in great afflictions? I anſwer, though they are afflicted, yet they proſper. When they are impoveriſhed, they are enriched, when they are as <hi>having nothing, they poſſeſſe all things.</hi> What is there? vvhat can there be, even in their ſaddeſt eſtate, which doth not conduce to their good, vvhich will not be a benefit unto them?</p>
                  <p>For firſt, their troubles are but trials; now is there any hurt in a triall, or perturbation in a probation? Troubles try their graces, and their corruptions too. Trouble tryes grace that it may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, and corruption that it may be mortified; there is no hurt in all this: rather it is a moſt happy condition, which makes grace conſpicuous: whereby a mans beſt ſide, his inſide (wherein his glory lies, <hi>The Kings Daughter is glorious within)</hi> is turned out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. That Scripture <hi>(Dan.</hi> 11. 33, 34, 35.) is very pregnant to the point in hand; where the Prophet foretelling troubleſome times, ſaith, <hi>They that underſtand amongst the people ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt many, yet they ſhall fall by the ſword, and by flame, by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:40455:64"/> 
                     <hi>and by ſpoyle many dayes:</hi> They that underſtand, that is, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men ſhall fall by theſe judgements, ſome of them by the ſword, they ſhall utterly be cut off; ſome by flame, they ſhall be burnt to aſhes: others by captivity and by ſpoile, their eſtates ſhall be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, their perſons impriſoned. How doth this anſwer the juſtice of God (will carnall reaſon object) that it ſhall be <hi>thus ill, with the righteous, to whom the Lord promiſeth it ſhall be well?</hi> Yes, well enough. For it followeth, <hi>Now when they ſhall fall, they ſhall be holpen with a little helpe, and ſome of them of underſtanding ſhall fall,</hi> (that is, by captivity, and by ſpoile) <hi>to try them, and to purge them, and to make them white.</hi> Here are two remarkable ends, why They of underſtanding, fall into theſe evils. Firſt, for probation, <hi>to try them.</hi> Secondly, for cleanſing and purgation, <hi>to purge them and make them white.</hi> Gold is never wrong'd, by being tryed. A ſpotted garment, a diſtempered body, are not damnified by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by purging. To be freed from filth without, and bad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours within the body, is more then a common favour. How high an act of favour then is it, to have ill humours and filthy ſpots waſhed, purged out of the ſoule? Such baſe humours a good man may have, as call for theſe ſtrong working pils, Spoyling and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, to caſt them out. Now thoſe <hi>men of underſtanding</hi> have no more hurt intended them by God, when they fall into ſpoilers hands, then when a diſeaſed body fals into a Phyſitians hand, or when a defiled garment fals into a Fullers hand; <hi>ſc. to purge and make them white. Affliction is a cleanſer.</hi> Chriſt is the onely lava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and his blood the onely Fountaine to waſh away the guilt of ſinne; yet God hath other Fountains and Lavatories, to waſh away the pollution of ſin: That blood cleanſes in this ſenſe alſo, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally; and all the waters or fires of affliction have no efficacy at all, to refine or cleanſe, but in vertue of that blood. <hi>A Croſſe without a Chriſt never made any man better: But with Chriſt, all are made better by the Croſſe.</hi> We may then ſay at leaſt, that <hi>it is well with the righteous in affliction, foraſmuch as</hi> (through the bleſſing of God) <hi>they are bettered by affliction.</hi> When you ſee a godly man caſt out in the open aire, and having the waters of ſorrow powred continually upon him, know that he is only laid out a <hi>whitening,</hi> and will appeare ſhortly more reſplendant then ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, afflictions are ſent to humble. <hi>Pride is ſuch a weed, as often growes in the beſt ſoyle:</hi> Now that which humbleth us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt us; we loſe nothing by the abatements of our pride: no,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40455:65"/> the more pride loſes, the more we gain. And we ſeldome or never loſe any thing, but by pride. Now ſaith God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 1. If you would have an account, vvhy I brought my people about in the wilderneſſe, through ſo many difficulties; know, this vvas my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, <hi>it was to humble them.</hi> God reſiſts pride whereſoever he findes it (they in vvhom pride totally prevailes, are Gods enemies and he reſiſts them) they in vvhom pride hath ſome, yea great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency, may be Gods friends, and God will reſiſt pride in them: the difference is obſervable betvveen reſiſting of pride, and reſiſting the proud; the reſiſting of the perſon, and the reſiſting of the ſin. The great reſiſtance, vvhich God makes againſt the pride of mans heart, is by the rods of affliction; he vvhips them into humility, and by taking away carnall comforts, takes them off from carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. <hi>And O bleſſed affliction which makes us leſſe to our ſelves, and all creatures leſſe to us.</hi> We are never ſo much in Gods eye, as vvhen vve are leaſt in our own: nor have vve ever ſo much of God, as vvhen vve expect little, or leaſt from man; ſay therefore it is <hi>well with the righteous,</hi> vvhen they are in the deeps of affliction; for it is but to bring them off their Mountaines of pride, that they may be exalted in the ſtrength and love of God, even upon the Mountain of his Holineſſe and their glory for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Afflictions bring the Saints nearer to God. <hi>Troubles abroad cauſe the ſoule to looke inwards and homewards.</hi> Is there any hurt in being brought neerer to God? <hi>It is good for me to draw neer unto God,</hi> ſays <hi>David;</hi> and it is good for us to be drawn neer unto God, if vve vvill not come of our ſelves: It is a deſireable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, vvhich compels us heaven-ward. <hi>Heaven is but our neareſt being unto God;</hi> and by how much vve are nearer God on earth, ſo much the more vve have of Heaven, upon earth. Afflictions (as in the Prodigals example) put us upon thoughts of returing to God, and the more vve returne, the nearer vve are unto him; returning thoughts vvill not reſt, but under our fathers roofe: yea, returning thoughts vvill not reſt, till vve are got into our fathers armes, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of his wing, and this a happy condition indeed. As it vvas vvith <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove <hi>(Gen.</hi> 8. 9.) vvhen ſhe vvas ſent forth of the Ark, ſhe could finde no place for the ſoal of her foot to reſt on; ſhe knew not vvhether to go, for the vvaters vvere on the face of the whole earth; therefore ſhe returneth back, and comes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering about the Ark, as deſiring to be taken in: but after the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vvere aſſwaged, he ſent out a Dove, vvhich returned to him no
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40455:65"/> more. So when it is faire weather in the world, calme and ſerene; <hi>even Doves</hi> keepe off from God; and though they goe not quite away from him, yet they are not ſo deſirous of comming to him: but when we finde a deluge in the world, ſuch ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts of trouble, that we know not where to fix our ſouls for a day, then we come as the Dove fluttering about the Ark, and cry to our <hi>Eternall Noah,</hi> that we may be near him, yea, within, with him. Wicked men (like the Raven, which <hi>Noah</hi> ſent out firſt, Verſe 7. <hi>and returned not againe)</hi> care not for the Ark of Gods preſence in the greateſt troubles: to be neare God is more troubleſome to them, then all their troubles. But Believers, like the Dove, will look home (at leaſt) in foul weather. God is their chiefe friend at all times, and their onely friend in ſad times. Is there any harme in this? Chriſt ſends a ſtorme, but to draw his back to the Ark; <hi>That, at the laſt, where he is, there they may be alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we may ſay it is well with the righteous in their worſt condition of outward trouble, becauſe, <hi>God is with them; It can never be ill with that man, with whom God is.</hi> It is infinitely more to ſay, <hi>I will be with thee,</hi> then to ſay, peace is with thee, health is with thee, credit is with thee, honour is with thee. To ſay, <hi>God is with thee,</hi> is all theſe, and infinitely more. For in theſe you have but a particular good, in God you have all good: when God ſayes, I will be with you, you may make what you will out of it; ſit down and imagine with your ſelves whatſoever good you can deſire, and it is all comprehended in this one word, <hi>I will be with thee.</hi> Now God who is with the righteous at all times, is moſt with them in worſt times; then he ſaith in a ſpeciall ſenſe, <hi>I will be with thee. When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee. When thou walkeſt thhough the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 2. When a <hi>mighty winde</hi> paſſed before <hi>Eliah,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>That God was</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 19.</note> 
                     <hi>not in the winde:</hi> and when the <hi>Earthquake</hi> ſhook the Hils, and a conſuming fire appeared, it is ſaid, God was not in the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, not in the fire. God joynes not with outward troubles, for the terror of his people, but he joynes with outward troubles, for the comfort of his people. So he is in the fire, and in the winde, and in the Earthquake, and his preſence makes the fire but as a warme Sunne; the ſtormy winde, a refreſhing gale; and the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, hut a pleaſant dance.</p>
                  <p>So much for the removing of this objection, and clearing up the juſtice of God, reſpecting the afflictions of the righteous.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:40455:66"/>
                  <p> If any ſhall look on the other hand upon wicked men, as if God came not home in his juſtice, vvhile he ſuffers them to proſper.</p>
                  <p>Firſt I anſwer, their proſperity ſerves the providence of God, and therefore it doth not croſſe his juſtice. That, vvas <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezars</hi> caſe, <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 10. 6.) <hi>I will ſend him</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>againſt an hypocriticall nation:</hi> ſo then, he muſt proſper vvhile he goes upon Gods errand: but mark vvhat followes (Verſe 12.) <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that when the Lord hath performed his whole worke upon Mount Zion, ſc.</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> power, vvho vvas but doing the juſt vvork of God, vvhile he thought ambitiouſly of doing his own, (novv it is no injuſtice for God, to give an inſtrument power to do his work) and vvhen his bloody luſt hath performed the holy vvork of God, you ſhall ſee the Lord will take an order vvith him ſpeedily, For) then ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of Aſſyria, and the glory of his high looks;</hi> God let him alone to doe the work, he had ſet him about; and it was a righteous work of God upon his people, though <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> went about it, wlth a proud and malicious ſpirit againſt his people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the proſperity of wicked men ſerveth them, but as an opportunity, to ſhew how wicked and vile they are; to act and publiſh the ſeven abominations of their own hearts. Now as it is one of the greateſt mercies under Heaven, for a man to have his luſts quite mortified; ſo it is a very great mercy, for a man to have his luſts, but, reſtrained: It is a mercy for a man, to have that fuell taken away from his corruptions, upon which they feed: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be wrath and judgement upon wicked men, when God in ſtead of reſtraining their luſts, giveth them opportunity to inlarge their luſts, and layes the reines on their neck, to run whether and which way they pleaſe, without ſtop or controule. This is wrath, and high wrath, a ſore judgement, the ſoreſt judgement that can fall upon them: wherefore when vve thinke they are in a moſt proſperous condition they are in the moſt dreadfull condition, they are but filling themſelves with ſin, and fitting themſelves for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Many a mans luſts are altogether unmortified, which yet are chill'd and overawed by judgements. And there is more judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in having liberty to commit one ſinne, then in being ſhut up under the iron barres and adamantine neceſſities of a thouſand judgements: <hi>He that is Satans treaſury for ſin, ſhall be Gods trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury for wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:40455:66"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, Their proſperity is the judiciary hardning of their hearts, and <hi>a hard heart, is the greateſt judgment on this ſide Hell;</hi> As there is a naturally inbred and ſinfully acquired hard heart, ſo there is a judicially hardned, or a divinely inflicted hard heart: When to a naturall hard heart, and an acquired hard heart, which men get by many repeated acts of ſin, the Lord adds a judicially hardned, or inflicted hard heart, then <hi>wrath is heated to the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and judgment is within one ſtep of Hell.</hi> Eſpecially if we conſider, that every houre of ſuch proſperous impenitence, and hardneſſe of heart encreaſes puniſhment, and adds to the treaſury of that wrath, which is ſtored up againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God. Who thinks that man happy, who is let alone only to gather a mighty pile of wood, and other fuell of flames to burne himſelfe? while ungodly men ſaem to the world to be gathering riches, honour and pleaſure, hey are but gathering a heap of wrath, and a pile of fire; which at the laſt will flame ſo bright, that it will make a revelation, of the (formerly ſecret, but) ever righteous judgement of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To ſhew that God is juſt in all his dealings, both the righteous and the wicked, learne, from the end of both. That we may fully diſcover the Juſtice of God, we muſt looke upon all his works together; while we looke only upon ſome particular peece of Gods dealings with a godly man, he may ſeeme to deale very hardly with him: or if we looke but upon ſome particular peece of his dealings with a wicked man, God may ſeeme very gentle and kind towards him: but take all together, and <hi>the reſult is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act juſtice.</hi> It was a good ſpeech of a <hi>moderne writer, We muſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non eſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum de operibus Dei ante quintum actum.</hi> Per. Mart.</note> 
                     <hi>not judge of the works of God, before the fifth act,</hi> that is, the laſt act or concluſion of all. This, and that part may ſeeme diſſonant and confuſed, but lay them all together, and they are moſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious and methodicall: Hence <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 37.) after he had a great diſpute with himſelfe, about the troubles of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the proſperity of the wicked, and was put hard to it, how to make out the Juſtice of God, reſolves all in the cloſe with this advice (ver. 37.) <hi>Marke the perfect man, and behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> Though a righteous man die in warre, yet, his end is peace, whereas though a wicked man die in peace, yet his end is warre. It is ſaid <hi>(Deut.</hi> 8. 16.) that all which God did to his people in the wilderneſſe, was, <hi>that he might doe them good at the latter end.</hi> Come to the end therefore, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40455:67"/> there you ſhall find <hi>juſtice viſible:</hi> We often looſe the ſight of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in our travailes and paſſage through the world, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and hils interpoſe, which we cannot ſee over or through; but when we come home, and arrive at the end of our travailes, Juſtice will appeare in all her <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>glory, rendring to every man according to his deedes; To them who hy patient continuance in well doing, ſeeke for glory, and honour, and immortality, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life; but unto them that are contentious and doe not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſſe, indignation and wrath.</hi>

                     <hi>Joſhua</hi> concludes the ſtory of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in their paſſage to <hi>Canaan,</hi> with the higheſt teſtimonies of Gods juſtice and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; though God dealt with them ſo variouſly in the wildernes that they often murmured in their tents, as if he had done them wrong, yet in the cloſe you ſhall find, how exact and punctuall the Lord was with them, <hi>(Joſh.</hi> 21. 45.) <hi>There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had ſpoken to the houſe of Iſrael, all came to paſſe:</hi> And in that other text, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23. 14 <hi>Behold this day I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts, and in all your ſoules, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things, which the Lord your God ſpake concerning you, all are come to paſſe unto you, and not one thing hath failed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> How admirably juſt was God in his word? If a man promiſe many things, we take it well if he performe ſome of the chiefe, and them in the chiefe, though ſome what may faile. God promiſed many things, and performed all, and which is more, all of every one, of thoſe many things promiſed. The texts compared, make this out, the one ſaying, <hi>That not one thing failed of all the good things, which God ſpake concerning them.</hi> And the other, <hi>That not ought of any good thing failed.</hi> So then, they had every good thing in kind, with each particular part and degree of every good thing: And for the truth of all this, <hi>Joſhua</hi> makes his appeale to themſelves, and to that in themſelves, which was beſt able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it, <hi>All their hearts, and all their ſoules;</hi> which words doe not only referre to every perſon, as if the meaning were, <hi>The hearts and ſoules of you all;</hi> but rather to all that is in every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>All their hearts, and all their ſoules,</hi> that is, underſtandings, memories, conſciences. affections, yea ſences, their eyes and eares, their hands and mouthes, could bring in witneſſe from their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall operations, to this great truth. And ſurely God in the end will deale as well with every Iſraelite, as he did with all <hi>Iſrael:</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:40455:67" rendition="simple:additions"/> A time will come, it will come ſhortly, when every <hi>Saint ſhall ſay, in all their hearts and in all their ſoules,</hi> that not one thing nor ought of any one good thing, which the Lord hath ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, hath failed. I ſhut up this, in the words of Chriſt to his Diſciples, when they were amuſed about that act of his, the waſhing of their feet, <hi>(John</hi> 13. 7.) <hi>What I doe, ye know not now, but ye ſhall know hereafter.</hi> Stay but a while, and all thoſe <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and riddles of providence</hi> ſhall be unfolded. <hi>Though clouds and darkneſſe are round about him, yet Judgement and Juſtice are the habitation of his Throne,</hi> Pſal. 97. <hi>Mortall man never had, and at laſt ſhall ſee he had no reaſon, to complaine of God; mortall man ſhall not be more juſt than God; nor ſhall man be more pure than his maker.</hi> And ſo much for the fifth Concluſion, That God neither doth nor can doe any injuſtice to the creature, he is juſt in his nature, juſt and holy in all his wayes.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth or laſt Concluſion is this, <hi>That to complaine of Gods</hi>

                     <hi>He ever preſerved high and holy thoughts of God,</hi> The leaſt ſuſpition of whoſe righteous dealings, is to make our ſelves, by ſo much more righteous, then he.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40455:68"/> It is ſeaſonable for us to look to our hearts in ſuch a time as this; it is a time of temptation, let us not by our murmurings, make it a time of provocation: Poſſibly we may often ſee cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of men, but we can never have cauſe to complaine of God. There is but little good got by complaining of creatures but how much guilt and miſery gets he, who complaines of his Creator? For a man to complaine to man, is in ſome caſes neceſſary, but it is beſt in all caſes, to complaine to God, and the worſt of any caſe, to complaine (though ſilently) of God. So then, complaine of man to God, rather then of man, to men; complaine often to God, but never of God: Complaine before God, and tell him, that, ſuch have dealt negligently, ſuch falſely, ſuch unjuſtly, ſuch cruelly; But alwayes ſay, <hi>Lord thou haſt done juſtly, even by thoſe who are unjuſt; Lord thou haſt done gratiouſly, even by thoſe who are wicked; Lord thou haſt done holily, even by the hand of thoſe who are unholy; and thou haſt dealt faithfully, though theſe have been treacherous.</hi> Thus let us complaine to God, but not of God. Every complaint of God will be interpreted, a ſecret juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our ſelves, and a condemnation of the righteous God. Man is then worſe then a Devill, when he would make himſelfe better then God: <hi>Nothing pollutes man, ſo much as this thought, that there is unrighteouſneſſe in God: Nothing debaſes the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo much, as that thought, deſire or act, wherein he prefers and exalts himſelfe above the Creator.</hi>

                     <hi>ELiphaz</hi> having laid the dignity of man (comparing with God) in the duſt, by thoſe humbling queſtions, in the former verſe, <hi>what is man that he ſhould be just? and ſhall man be more pure than his Maker?</hi> He now ſtrengthens it further, that there is no compariſon between <hi>God and mortall man,</hi> by a direct aſſertion, that there is no compariſon between <hi>God, and immortall Angells.</hi>

                     <hi>Behold he put no truſt in his ſervants, and his Angels he charged with folly.</hi> As if he had ſaid, If Angels are not able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and juſtifie themſelves upon his enquirie; then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, the beſt of men, who dwell but in houſes of clay cannot: But Angels cannot juſtifie themſelves before God, therefore much leſſe can the beſt of men. That Angels are not able to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, he proves in theſe words: <hi>Behold he put no truſt in his ſervants, and his Angels he charged with folly:</hi> They that cannot be truſted by God, cannot be juſtified by God: And they that are chargeable with folly, are not able to ſtand in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the moſt wiſe, the only wiſe and holy God. Angels are excellent creatures, yet becauſe creatures, they are in, and of themſelves, fraile and weake: they have no ſtrength to ſtand longer then upheld, no ſtedfaſtneſſe to obey, longer than confirmed, no faithfullneſſe to be loyall, longer than overruled, no wiſedome to diſcerne, further than they are enlightned; what then will become of man, if he ſtand alone, or ſtand in competition with <hi>God his Maker?</hi> This is the ſumme and generall ſenſe of the words as they are an argument. We will now conſider them as they lye here in order.</p>
                  <q>Behold he put no truſt in his ſervants.</q>
                  <p>The particle <hi>[Behold]</hi> in the Originall, as it often notes wonder in other texts, ſo it may, much more in this, <hi>Behold</hi> a wonder, <hi>Angels are fooliſh, Angels are not to be truſted;</hi> yet in this place, <hi>Behold,</hi> is put by way of affirmation, rather then of admiration. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he put no truſt in his ſervants,</hi> is as much as <hi>verily and indeed, certainly and without controverſie, he put no truſt in his ſervants;</hi> So <hi>(Deut.</hi> 13 14.) <hi>Thou ſhalt inquire and ſearch, and aske dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and behold if it be true;</hi> in the Hebrew thus, and <hi>behold true,</hi> or <hi>behold truth;</hi> that is, if upon enquirie it appeare, that ſucb and ſuch things are certainly ſo, then, they muſt proceed according to the Law provided in that caſe. Againe <hi>(Deut.</hi> 19. 18.) <hi>The Judges ſhall make diligent inquiſition, and behold, if the witneſſe be a falſe witneſſe,</hi> ſo we tranſlate; but the letter is, <hi>Behold the witneſſe, a falſe witneſſe,</hi> that is, if it be affirmed, and doe appeare that it is a falſe witneſſe or teſtimonie which is brought, then the Judges ſhall proceed ſo and ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus here, <hi>Behold he put no truſt in his ſervants,</hi> is a vehement affirmation, that God ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into thoſe his ſervants, finds them ſuch as are not to be truſted</p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:40455:69"/>
                  <p> But who are theſe untruſty ſervants? Firſt, The <hi>Chaldee para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt</hi> underſtands by <hi>ſervants,</hi> the <hi>holy Prophets;</hi> Prophets (I grant) ſometimes have, and oftner would have proved unfaithfull; ſome of them, diſcovered much, and others would have diſcovered more unfaithfulneſſe, if God had not mightily ſupported them.

                  <p>But the connexion of the text carries it clearely, that by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we are to underſtand the <hi>Angels,</hi> who are called <hi>miniſtring ſpirits,</hi> Heb. 1. 14. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits</hi> (or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) <hi>ſent out for the good of thoſe that are the heires of ſalvation?</hi> And ſo the words in the cloſe of this verſe, are <hi>exigeticall,</hi> expounding who are intended by thoſe ſervants; <hi>Behold he put no truſt in his ſervants, and his Angels he charged with folly;</hi> that is, he truſted not thoſe ſervants the Angels, but charged them with folly.

He ſaw ſomewhat in them, which might betray them to diſloyaltie, if himſelfe withdrawing his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhould make an experiment, or try what was in their hearts. And this ſenſe is moſt ſuitable to the ſtate and office of a ſervant: truſting or not truſting, faithfulneſſe, or unfaithfulneſſe, are acts proper to that relation, <hi>Lord and Servant.</hi> So then the <hi>Lord put no truſt,</hi> or he could not confide in his ſervants, they being ſuch as he found not perfectly ſure and loyall unto him.

Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribes a faithfull Wife and a confiding Husband, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31, 10, 11. A rare couple indeed, and as rarely found. Therefore he makes proclamation for ſuch a woman; <hi>who can finde a vertuous Woman? for her price is farre above Rubies, the heart of her Husband doth ſafely truſt in her, ſo that he ſhall have no need of ſpoile:</hi> there's confidence to the height, <hi>the heart of her Husband doth ſafely truſt in her.</hi> A Husband that hath ſuch a Jewell to his Wife, knowes, ſhe will order the family with diſcretion at home, when he's abroad: he knowes ſhe is faithfull to him body and goods.

So God knew all Angels, the uttermoſt perfection, power, and vertue that was in Angels, therefore he would not commit all to them, he would not believe upon them. We finde the word belief thus uſed, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 14. 31.) when the children of Iſrael ſaw the great work, that the Lord had wrought in deſtroying the Egyptians, it is ſaid, <hi>The people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and his ſervant Moſes;</hi> he puts God and <hi>Moſes</hi> as the joynt object of their faith: as they had formerly been of their unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Except the ſervants of the Lord be believed, the Lord himſelfe is not. And when they are believed, the Lord is. Believe in the Lord your God, believe his Prophets,</hi> ſaith good <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> to his people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20 20. <hi>Moſes</hi> had told them enough of the power of God before, he had undertaken they ſhould be delivered, but they would not truſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> upon his word, nor would they truſt the Word of God: yet now when they ſaw this great deliverance, preſent ſight wrought faith for the time to come: they perceived by this miracle, that the Lord and <hi>Moſes</hi> were to be credited, &amp; they doubted not, to credit them another time. <hi>Though that faith which comes in at the eyes only, ſeldome goes downe ſo low, as the heart, or ſees further and</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:40455:70"/> 
                     <hi>longer then the eye.</hi> Thus we may underſtand the firſt part of the Verſe, <hi>He put no truſt,</hi> no belief in his ſervants, he gave no credit to them, as knowing perfectly what their nature and power was, what both could do: that if left by God, they would quickly leave God, and prove unfaithfull.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall obſerve one point, before I come to the latter part of the Verſe (for there the ſuſpition of diſloyaltie upon the Angels comes more fully to be conſidered) from the title here given to the Angels, His ſervants, <hi>he put no truſt in his ſervants, Angels are the ſervants of God.</hi> They are his ſervants, as being altogether at his command, and they are his ſervants, as being fully conformable to his commands. Theſe great and glorious Spirits, come under the ſame title and denomination with men, who dwell in houſes of clay, <hi>ſervants of God.</hi> To ſerve God, is not only the duty, but it is the honour of the higheſt creatures. <hi>It is more honour to ſerve God, then to rule the world.</hi> The ſtile of the good Angels, is, <hi>Miniſtring Spirits, Heb.</hi> 1. but the ſtile and title of the evill Angel, is, <hi>Prince of the power of the aire, God of this word:</hi> you would think theſe were weighty titles, <hi>Prince of the aire, God of the world,</hi> but the additions diminiſh their weight, yea, make them lighter then vanity, or rather, heavie only with miſery: <hi>There is more glory in being a ſervant of God, than in being a god of the world, or a Prince of the power of the aire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might here enlarge my enquiry into the ſervices of Angels, in what they are ſervants, and what their offices and duties are, but I ſhall only touch. Their ſervice may be conſidered either in reſpect of the Church, or the enemies of the Church. Reſpecting the Church and people of God, they have ſuch ſervices as theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they are as meſſengers to carry and reveale the minde of God. They are as Tutors and inſtructors of the Churches, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 9. God ſent his Angel to teach <hi>Daniel</hi> the myſterie of thoſe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 11. an Angel was ſent to inſtruct <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 22. 16. <hi>I Jeſus have ſent mine Angell to teſtifie theſe things in the Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are ſent as guardians and protectors of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, to take their part, and to be on their ſide, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him. Pſal.</hi> 91. 11. <hi>He giveth his Angels a charge over them, leſt at any time they ſhould daſh their feet againſt a ſtone. Gen.</hi> 32. 2. When <hi>Jacob</hi> journied, it is ſaid, <hi>the Angels of God met him;</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:40455:71"/> an army of Angels was his Convoy, Gods Hoaſt coming out for his protection and ſafeguard, and therefore he called the name of that place <hi>Nahanaim,</hi> that is, <hi>two Hoſts or Camps;</hi> either becauſe the Angels appeared in two bands, and ſo made as it were a guard for <hi>Jacob</hi> to paſſe between them. Or, becauſe the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Royall Army, quartered and marched with <hi>Jacobs</hi> little Army; and ſo two confederate Armies appeared in the field to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Angels are called Chariots, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 17. <hi>The Chariots of God are twenty thouſand, even thouſands of Angels.</hi> That is, God uſeth Angels for defence of his people, as Chariots in Warr. The ancient Prophets were called the Chariots of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 13.) and the Angels are the Chariots of God. <hi>Our ſtrongeſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia is of Spirits, or of men ſpiritualiz'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Angels ſuggeſt good things, holy thoughts to us. If the Devill, who is an evill Angel, a wicked ſpirit, can ſuggeſt evill, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full filthy thoughts, and help on the heart in wickedneſſe; then doubtleſſe a good Angel can help on the heart in holineſſe, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly thoughts and meditations. Chriſt ſpeaks of <hi>Judas,</hi> that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had put it into his heart to betray him, John</hi> 13. and <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias (Acts</hi> 5.) <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lye to the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> The nature of a good Angel is as fit, his power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as great, to deale with our ſpirits, as either the nature or the power of an evill Angel. That of the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14.) gives a hint, if not a proofe of it, where he tels the <hi>Corinthians, That deceitfull workers transforme themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and no marvell, for Sathan himſelfe is transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Angell of light,</hi> and when is Satan in this change from an <hi>Angel of darkneſſe</hi> to <hi>an Angel of light?</hi> even when <hi>He ſuggeſts good for evill ends, or evill for good ends.</hi> And if he is called <hi>an Angel of light</hi> for this reaſon, then <hi>Angels of light, good Angels</hi> ſuggeſt good, for good ends; otherwiſe, Satan could not be ſaid to imitate them, in ſuggeſting good for ill ends, and under ſpecious pretences of bringing glory to God, tempting to tranſgreſſe the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, good Angels comfort, ſtrengthen and ſupport, in times of diſtreſſe, anguiſh and trouble: an Angel comforted <hi>Hagar Gen.</hi> 21 and <hi>(Matth.</hi> 4. 10.) after Chriſt had finiſhed his terrible combat with that wicked Angel, the good <hi>Angels came and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto him.</hi> Againe, when he was in that moſt bitter <hi>Agony in the garden (Luke</hi> 22. 43.) <hi>an Angel appeared to him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:40455:71"/> 
                     <hi>ſtrengthning him.</hi> That which they do to Chriſt the Head, they do to his members in their proportion.</p>
                  <p>Their fifth ſervice, is to conveigh and carry the ſoules of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints to Heaven: they are <hi>Heavenly Porters (Luke.</hi> 16. 22.) <hi>Lazarus dyed, and was carried by the Angels into Abrahams boſome.</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, they ſhall convocate and gather all the Elect together at the laſt day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. Their ſervices againſt the wicked and all enemies of the Church have been many and great. <hi>Angels aſſiſt Saints,</hi> and oppoſe the oppoſers of <hi>Sion.</hi> Two Angels were ſent upon a meſſage of deſtruction to <hi>Sodome;</hi> an Angel defeated the Hoaſt of <hi>Senacherib;</hi> an Angel ſmote bloody perſecuting <hi>Herod;</hi> Angels (by name, if not by nature) powre out the ſeven vials of Gods wrath in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And at the laſt day Angels ſhall hurry the wicked to Chriſts Tribunall; they are <hi>heavenly Purſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> and they ſhall bundle the Tares up together, as fuell to be throwne into everlaſting burnings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 41, 42.</p>
                  <p>And it may be a great comfort to us, that God hath ſuch ſervants. When viſible dangers are round about us, we ſhould remember, God hath inviſible ſervants round about us. <hi>There are more with us, then againſt us,</hi> as <hi>Eliſha</hi> told his fearfull ſervant, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. And in that low eſtate of the Church, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 8. the Prophet is ſhewed <hi>Chriſt in a viſion ſtanding among the Mirtle trees in the bottome,</hi> (the Mirtle trees in the bortome, noted the Church in a low eſtate) <hi>and behinde him there were red Horſes, ſpeckled and white;</hi> that is, horſemen ſpeckled and white. Theſe diverſe colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Horſes were Angels appointed for ſeverall offices, as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Junius</hi> (with others) interprets it; The <hi>red horſes</hi> being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for judgement, the <hi>white</hi> for mercy, and the ſpeckled, (as he conjectures) for mixt actions, being ſent out, at once to protect and help the people of God, and to execute wrath and judgement upon the adverſary. Thus we ſee the ſervices of the Angels; they are ſervants, yet ſuch as <hi>the moſt wiſe God put no truſt in;</hi> therefore we have <hi>an Angel better</hi> then Angels, even the <hi>Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> the Lord Jeſus, into whoſe hands our ſafety is committed, to whoſe care the Church is left, in whom God puts the whole truſt, knowing that this <hi>great Angel,</hi> is, and for ever will be faithfull, in and over his houſe, to his higheſt delight, and the Churches compleateſt welfare.</p>

                  <p>There are very different readings of this part of the Verſe.

                  <p>Now that which hath given occaſion to this variety of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, is the different ſenſes which the Originall yields us. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word is very fruitfull of ſignifications, and hath (as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle told <hi>Rebecca</hi> concerning two contrary Nations) two contrary meanings in the wombe of it, and that makes the ſtrugling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Interpreters. The word in its proper ſenſe ſignifies to <hi>ſhine forth with a reſplendent brightneſſe,</hi> ſo Chap. 29. 3. <hi>Job wiſheth, O that I were as in moneths paſt, when the candle of God ſhined upon my head;</hi> it is a Verbe of which the word folly in this text of <hi>Job</hi> is a derivative. And <hi>(Iſay</hi> 14. 12.) <hi>Hielel</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Morning ſtar,</hi> whoſe ſhining brightneſſe hath obtained the name <hi>Lucifer, Light-bringer,</hi> or <hi>Light-bearer. How art thou fallen from Heaven O Lucifer, ſonne of the Morning? How art thou fallen from Heaven, Hielel, thou ſhining day-ſtar?</hi> Thus, the word properly ſignifies ſhining or brightneſſe, or to ſhine and be bright: and hence by a <hi>Metaphor</hi> to be <hi>Famous,</hi> or renowned, or to make one renowned or famous, or to paint out a man with praiſes; becauſe a man is (as it were) decked with light, and hath rayes of brightneſſe caſt upon him, when he is honoured and adorned with praiſes. Due commendations are to a man as a robe or veſture of light, which makes him ſhine to all about him. And hence the word <hi>Halelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> is derived, <hi>praiſe ye Jah,</hi> or the Lord; uſed frequently both in the beginning and end of the Pſalmes: in the beginning of the Pſalmes by way of exhortation, and in the end by way of acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, crying up the honour and glory of God. And (to note that in paſſage) it is well obſerved, that this word <hi>Hallelujah</hi> is firſt uſed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40455:72"/> in the old Teſtament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 35. where the utter conſumption of ſinners is mentioned; and in the New Teſtament it is firſt uſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 3 6. where the utter conſumption of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied. <hi>Judgement on the wicked, is matter of high praiſe to God.</hi> Thirdly, the word ſignifies (by the figure <hi>Antiphraſis or contrary ſpeaking)</hi> to boaſt and brag vainly, fooliſhly; or vaine fooliſh boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>To commend or extoll our ſelves is pride running mad, and arrogance diſtracted.</hi> It is the higheſt dotage to be in love with our owne wiſdome and folly, to publiſh our own works. There may be wiſdom (though oftentimes there is a great deale of folly) in commending others, but in commending our ſelves, there can be nothing but folly: therefore the very ſame word which ſignifies to boaſt and commend our ſelves; ſignifies both the concrete, to be mad, vaine, or fooliſh; and the abſtract, madneſſe and folly: thus in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 2, 12. the word is uſed, <hi>I ſaid of laughter thou art mad. I turned my ſelfe to behold wiſdome, and folly, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 4. <hi>I ſaid unto the fooles, deale not fooliſhly,</hi> or to the mad-men, do not play the mad-men, that is, do not exalt your ſelves, for ſo he clears his meaning in the fifth Verſe, <hi>Lift not up your hornes on high, ſpeak not with a ſtiffe neck,</hi> that is, a neck ſtifned with pride, and a horne lifted up with vaine-glory or ſelf-confidence.</p>
                  <p>From this variety of ſignifications, the variety of tranſlations before toucht, ariſeth. Firſt they who read it, <hi>He put light into thoſe his meſſengers,</hi> take the word in a proper ſtrict ſenſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out the meaning thus; that God having put the light of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent knowledge into the Angels, could not yet truſt them: all their ſpeculative knowledge, and high raiſed illuminations, were not enough to make them ſteadily and ſteadfaſtly holy: that is the intent of Mr. <hi>Beza's</hi> interpretation, <hi>He truſted not to his ſervants, though he had put light into thoſe his meſſengers.</hi> For thoſe who retaining the word <hi>light</hi> tranſlate negatively, <hi>neither hath he put light in his Angels,</hi> or <hi>neither hath he put perfect light into his Angels;</hi> or as Mr. <hi>Broughton, In his Angels he judgeth no cleare light to be,</hi> putting a negative particle in both branches of the Verſe, whereas in the Hebrew there is no expreſſe negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the latter. Theſe, I ſay, are led by this reaſon or rule. It is frequent in Scripture, when there is a negative in the former clauſe of a Verſe, then to underſtand a negative alſo in the latter clauſe, though none be expreſt. For inſtance <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 9. 18.) <hi>The needy ſhall</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:40455:73"/> 
                     <hi>not alway be forgotten, the expectation of the poore ſhall not periſh for ever;</hi> ſo we read, but in the Hebrew the latter clauſe is, <hi>the expectation of the poore ſhall periſh for ever:</hi> there is no Negative in the <hi>Originall;</hi> but our <hi>Tranſtators,</hi> and not only they, but all that I have ſeen upon the place, render it ſo, ſupplying the Negative particle of the former, in the latter clauſe of that ſentence. And without that negative, the ſentence is not only imperfect, but untrue. Thus, <hi>The needy ſhall not alwayes be forgotten the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the poore ſhall periſh for ever,</hi> this were a contradiction: but reading it, the expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh for ever, makes the whole a truth, and congruous in it ſelf. Againe <hi>(Pro.</hi> 17. 26.) <hi>To puniſh the juſt is not good, to ſtrike Princes for equity,</hi> ſo the letter of the Hebrew; but we reade it thus, <hi>To puniſh the juſt is not good, nor to ſtricke Princes for equity.</hi> I might give ynu other examples, but a taſt may ſuffice Thus in the Text before us, when it is ſaid in the firſt clauſe, <hi>he put no truſt in his ſervants,</hi> we take up the negative, and ſay in the ſecond, <hi>neither hath he put light into his Angels,</hi> or <hi>he did not put light in his Angels,</hi> or <hi>he put no perfect light in his Angels,</hi> or <hi>he judged not cleare light to be in his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they, who (according to our Tranſlation) render it <hi>madneſſe or ſolly, vain boaſting or vanity,</hi> theſe take the Originall in that figurative ſence before given. When a man from a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon his own worth, boaſts out his own praiſes, which, becauſe it is a point of extreame vanity and folly, therefore the word is elegantly applyed to ſignifie <hi>folly, &amp;c. He charged his Angels with folly. He put or laid folly upon, or to his Angels;</hi> He put, for ſo the Hebrew word bears. Not, that the vanity which is in Angels is of Gods putting, but the folly that is in them, he <hi>puts to them, or char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Such a one put it home upon him;</hi> that is, he charged him ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or fully, with ſuch a crime or offence. To charge, is a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall or Law-term, implying, that the Lord ſitting in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to examine the ſtate of Angels, charged them by way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and upon triall found them (in a ſenſe) guilty of that, which, though they had not formed into any one ſin, yet might be formed and ſhap'd into any ſin, <hi>Folly or vaine-glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having given ſome account of thoſe tearms, <hi>Charging</hi> and <hi>Folly, He charged his Angels with folly,</hi> it growes to a great doubt what Angels we are here to underſtand: what Angels did God thus
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40455:73"/> charge with folly? The quere or doubt lies, whether we ſhall lay this charge at the doore of the good Angels, or of the bad, or of both.</p>
                  <p>Many of the Ancients reſtrain it to the evill Angels to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels;</hi> God put no truſt in them, he ſaw folly in them; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for confeſſed, that the Angels which ſtood, the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are truſty ſervants, diſcreet and wiſe, farre from, either unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe or folly; ſuch, as God hath put truſt in, and they never deceiv'd his truſt; ſuch whoſe obedience is made the pattern of ours, by Chriſt himſelf in his patterne of prayer, <hi>Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> And would the Lord regulare us by them who are themſelves irregular? or make them our copy in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will, whoſe folly renders them unfit to be truſted with the doing of his will? Therefore (ſay theſe) ſuch a charge ſuits not the ſtate and condition of the good Angels.</p>
                  <p>Others caſt it upon the good Angels, that God put no truſt, no, not in them. I conceive, from either there may be a good ſenſe, though I incline to the latter. For in the Apoſtate Angels (take it in the broadeſt ſenſe) God ſaw no light, no goodneſſe, no faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all; they have plainly diſcovered themſelves, and ſhewed, not only weakneſſe and unfaithfulneſſe, but wickedneſſe and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt folly. But to confine it to the evill Angels, or to underſtand it chiefly of them, is too narrow for the Text; eſpecially, ſeeing <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Angeli boni ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe nihil habent niſi inſantam negativè,</hi> i. e. <hi>nullam exſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>entiam, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam veritatem, bonitatem nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam.</hi>
                     </note> this is but a light, a too eaſie charge for <hi>thoſe Apoſtate Spirits</hi> to ſay onle thus that God found unfaithfulneſſe in them, and charged them with folly: for in them rebellion was found, and they ſtand charged to this day with High Treaſon, againſt the Crowne and dignity of the King of Heaven: and are therefore committed to priſon, and reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe to the judgement of the great day. As for the good Angels, God may be ſaid to charge them with folly without any wrong, either to the holineſſe of their nature, or the ſtedfaſtnes of their obedience. For upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination (or intuition rather) he finds, they have no wiſdome, or ſtability, but by Divine bounty and eſtabliſhment. As the apoſtate Angels were poſitively full of folly and unfaithfulnes ſo the good Angels might be charged with folly, negatively, namely, that they had no faithfullneſſe, but as aſſiſted and propt up.</p>
                  <p>But, we may take the Angels in a third or middle conſideration neither for the fallen or apoſtate Angels, nor for the good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Angels as diſtinct, or ſince this diſtinction: But by Angels we may underſtand the <hi>Angelicall nature;</hi> the whole complex
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40455:74"/> nature of Angels in their creation and conſtitution was ſuch, as God could not truſt fully unto, ſuch as he ſaw folly in. We may demonſtrate this plainly, becauſe a great part of the Angels (and it is queſtioned whether or no the geater part) but it is clear, that a great part of the Angels, a whole Regiment at leaſt, proved diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and fell together: therefore the Angelicall nature (in that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted notion) is ſubject to folly and unfaithfulnes, as well as man, although they are of a more excellent make and conſtitution then man. God looking upon Angels in generall, ſaw they were not to be truſted; the event alſo ſhewing many of them (who were as good by nature as they who ſtand) falling from him diſcovering their folly and nakedneſſe to all the world.</p>
                  <p>But it may be queſtioned yet, how there could be folly in the Angelicall nature, for as much as God viewing and reviewing all the works, which he had made, <hi>ſaw every thing which he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt God charged them with folly <hi>comparatively,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting himſelf. As (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16.) the Apoſtle ſaith of God, <hi>that he only hath immortality;</hi> that ſpeech is excluſive, ſhutting out all other creatures from a participation of Gods immortality. Yet we know Angels are immortall, Angels dye not, therefore alſo they are oppoſed to men (in the next Verſe to the Text) <hi>who live in houſes of clay, whoſe foundations are in the duſt, and are cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the moth;</hi> Angels are not cruſhed, they dye not, yet God only is immortall; becauſe the immortality of Angels compared with the immortality of God, is but mortality. And the reaſon is this, becauſe Angels are not immortall in themſelves, or of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they have not originall or abſolute immortality, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is dependent and derivative; God only is independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">

He is wiſe of himſelf, and in himſelf, in his own compaſſe creatures have only what they borrow or receive from him. To this ſenſe on of the Ancients ſpeaks fully, <hi>In compariſon of the juſtice of God, if the holy Angels in heaven be called unjuſt, I ſee no hurt in the aſſertion not becauſe they have fallen from juſtice, but becauſe they are creatures, and not God.</hi> All is reſolved into this, <hi>they are creatures,</hi> that's
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40455:74"/> enough to prove their folly, and unfaithfulneſſe And, if a man that hath not only ſome ſmattering of learning and knowledge but is a profeſſed Scholer, be looked upon as ignorant, compared with the <hi>Ben-clerks</hi> and great Scholers of the world; is it any wonder that Angels ſhould be called fools, in reference to the infinite wiſdome of God? <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then men, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is ſtronger then men.</hi> And it is as true of Angels, the fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then Angels, and the weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then Angels. Angels are called <hi>Principalities and powers,</hi> but yet, it is only becauſe they act in the power of God; and go forth in his ſtrength, that's the firſt anſwer. The whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels is unfaithfull and fooliſh, weighed with God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, although in the Angels there is no actuall unfaithfulneſſe or folly, yet there is poſſible folly &amp; unfaithfulneſſe in Angels; and, this potentiality is the thing here meant or aimed at. <note place="margin">

It is otherwiſe with man (which makes a wide difference between Angels and men.) Man not only hath a potentiality to be fooliſh &amp; unfaithfull, but man is actuall fooliſh and unfaithfull; yea man in himſelf is nothing elſe, but a bundle of folly and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. Whereas Angels in themſelves, or conſidered in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſtitution, have no folly actually in them at all. <hi>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is nothing but ſinne, and Angels have no ſinne at all in their nature;</hi> they only have a potentiality, a poſſibility in their nature to ſinne. So then, we muſt underſtand this charge of folly with two cautions concerning Angels. Firſt, there was not any folly concreated with them, their nature is <hi>purely pure.</hi> Secondly, they have not contracted any folly into their nature. The folly of the good Angels is but like the folly of man in the ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when he had only a power to ſin: which poſſibility of Angels to ſin is by the mediation of Chriſt (wherein theſe Angels have a ſhare though not to redeem or raiſe them from their Fall (as man) yet to confirme and keep them from falling) I ſay, by the mediation of Chriſt that poſſibility is removed. Chriſt hath changed their poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to ſin, into an impoſſibility of ſinning. This is a glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge indeed, and that which all the Saints ſhall have in glory. Redemption hath not only bettered the condition of man, but the condition of Angels. Now <hi>they all excell in ſtrength, doing the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40455:75"/> commandements of God, and harkning to the voice of his word for ever. Pſal.</hi> 103. 20.</p>
                  <p>We may hence learne, firſt, <hi>What the ſin of Angels was,</hi> God charged his Angels with folly; The poſſible ſin, which God ſaw and ſtill ſees, in the nature of Angels, was the actuall ſin of Angels. Pride &amp; ſelfe confidence were the ſins of Angels, and theſe are the moſt proper ſins of Angels; Angels cannot fall into every ſin. The Schooleman queſtions, <hi>Whether the firſt ſin of Angels was pride?</hi> He argues and concludes that howſoever in regard of guilt, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, <note place="margin">

                  <p>Now a ſpirituall nature, is not affected with thoſe ſins, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a corporall or ſenſitive nature; Devils are not adulterers, they are not drunkards; theirs are ſpirituall ſins, and their chiefe ſpirituall ſin, was pride; Their firſt ſin conſiſted in not ſubmitting themſelves to that condition, wherein God placed them, and whereunto they were appointed. All agree it was pride, though there be different opinions about what this pride ſhewed if ſelfe; whether in affecting a higher degree, then God created them in refuſing the work and office God ſet them about, (which ſome conceive, was the miniſtration to, or the guardianſhip of man, which truſt they deſerted or ſcorned) or whether it were in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a further condition upon their own ſtrength, not looking to the ſtrength and grace of God, whatſoever the particular was, the generall is plaine, <hi>they abode not in the truth, they kept not their ſtation: Pride and ambition ſwel'd them, till they brake and fell.</hi>

                     </note> though they are the beſt of creatures, yet they are changeable creatures; though they are the moſt perfect creatures, yet there is ſomewhat in them of imperfection. Looke upon Angels in their creation, they were created bleſſed; Bleſſed (as the Schooles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine) with a naturall bleſſedneſſe, not with a ſupernaturall which conſiſts in the viſion of God; for, if they had been created in a ſupernaturall bleſſedneſſe, then they had never fallen; they were created only in a naturall bleſſedneſſe, and from that they might fall and did. Now, indeed the good Angels have obtained by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40455:75"/> Chriſt a ſupernaturall bleſſedneſſe, from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they cannot fall; and ſo by grace are become immutable, which by creation they were not. Though Chriſt be not a Redeemer (as was toucht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) yet he is a confirmer, a ſupporter of the holy Angels. In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whereunto, Chriſt is called the <hi>head of all things</hi> (Eph. 1. 22.) <hi>And of him the whole family in Heaven, and in earth is named,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 15. And <hi>by him</hi> (Col. 1. 20.) <hi>God hath reconciled all things unto himſelfe, by him I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in Heaven.</hi> Some underſtand that place in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians</hi> of men only, becauſe of the word <hi>reconciling,</hi> yet we may well take in Angels alſo, becauſe, that place takes in all things, both in Heaven and earth. And howſoever Angels needed not ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, as ſuppoſes a breach of peace, or a falling out, before: yet they needed ſuch a reconciliation, as conſiſts in the continuance and ſtrengthning of that peace which was before.</p>
                  <p>Further, We learne by way of Corollary from the former point, <hi>That there is no ſtability in any eſtate out of Chriſt;</hi> The Angels themſelves could not be truſted out of Chriſt; folly is in them not conſidered in Chriſt, how much more in man? When <hi>Adam</hi> fell, if God ſhould have repaired him againe, and ſet him up <hi>(in ſtatu quo)</hi> in the ſame condition wherein he was, yea in a better (if a better could be had) without a Mediator; and ſo have tried his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience once more; or ſhould every particular man have ſtood for himſelfe, and not one for all; certainly, as we fell at firſt in a lump all together, ſo we ſhould have all fallen ſingle (as it were) by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, one after another: <hi>There is no aſſurance in any eſtate on this ſide Chriſt:</hi> Nor man, nor Angel can hold out without a Surety: Chriſt is called <hi>the Surety of the Covenant, Heb.</hi> 7. 22. becauſe he undertakes for us that we ſhall doe our parts, that we ſhall be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and beleeving, that we ſhall be holy and humble, that we ſhall doe what God expects from thoſe, whom free grace ſhall ſave: Chriſt undertakes for all the grace, and holineſſe, and faithfullneſſe which is required in beleevers; He gives no command, but what himſelfe helps us to fulfill, nor calls he for any duty, but what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe works in us and for us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly obſerve, <hi>That God ſees imperfection in creatures whoſe natures are moſt perfect.</hi> Man looking upon the Angelicall nature, or upon mans nature in innocency, could ſee no fault or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in either, but God ſaw both poſſibly faulty, though not actually faulty. And, as it is with the nature of men and Angels, ſo with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40455:76"/> their works: when we can ſee nothing amiſſe in a work, God can: as the Apoſtle acknowledges (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.) <hi>I know nothing by my ſelfe:</hi> I profeſſe, when I looke into the courſe of my miniſtery (for he ſpeakes to that particular) when I looke, how I have diſcharged my Apoſtleſhip, my conſcience beares me witneſſe, I know of no unfaithfulneſſe or neglect, but yet, <hi>though I know nothing by my ſelfe, I am not hereby juſtified, but he that judgeth me is the Lord:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, wheu God comes to looke over my worke, he may find faults, many faults in it; there is no ſtanding for creatures before God in any creature-purity: Angelicall perfection is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his ſight. Angels have not the leaſt ſpot or tincture of ſin in their nature, yet the nature of Angels is potentially ſinfull. The beſt creature (in regard of pure naturalls) may be wrought to evill, one God cannot. And the reaſon is, becauſe every one may erre, who hath not the rule of righteouſneſſe within him: and therefore it is impoſſible God ſhould erre, becauſe his own will is the rule of his own actions: He is every way a law unto himſelfe. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking of the Gentiles <hi>(Rom.</hi> 2. 14.) ſaith, <hi>Theſe having not the law, are a law unto themſelves.</hi> Not that their nature is a law, (which is the tranſcendent priviledge of God) but, that they have the law of nature, or the law printed in their nature, though not publiſhed to their eare; <hi>They have the law written in their hearts, but the heart of God is his law, both written and unwritten.</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures how perfect ſoever in their nature, have the will of God for their rule and law: which though it be within them, yet it is not <hi>Them,</hi> and ſo they may act beſide it. The hand of the Artificer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten failes in cutting or faſhioning the work he is about, becauſe his hand is not the rule by which he workes: his hand workes by a rule or line, his hand is not that rule or line, therefore he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtrikes right; and ſometimes he ſtrikes wrong; but if the hand of a man were the rule by which he works, then it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ever he ſhould worke amiſſe. Thus it is with God, the very will of God which acts, is the rule by which he acts, hence <note place="margin">

                  <p> Fifthly, Foraſmuch as God beholding Angels, ſees folly in them, learne, <hi>That God hath no need of any creature, no not of Aagels.</hi> The reaſon is clearely this, becauſe Angels themſelves in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are unfaithfull, Angels themſelves in themſelves are fooliſh, therefore what need hath God of ſuch as theſe? As King. <hi>Achiſh</hi> ſaid (1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 15.) when <hi>David</hi> changed his behaviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him (ſtudiouſly acting the foole &amp; mad man) ſcrabling on the doores of the gate, and letting his ſpittle fall downe upon his beard: What, ſaith <hi>Achiſh</hi> unto his ſervants, <hi>have I need of madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my preſence?</hi> So, God may ſay, when he lookes upon the beſt of creatures, Angels or men, have I any need of mad-men, any need of fooles or of their folly? Foraſmuch then, as there is nothing in any creature, barely as a crearure, but what may be reduced to folly and unfaithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and would certainely end there, therefore God hath no need at all of any creature. Men will ſay, we need not the helpe of diſloyall or untruſty men, we need not the helpe of fooles, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell us, or of unfaithfull ones, to act for us.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Creatures are no helpe to God: For the truth is, God and the creature, are no more than God alone; I ſay, God and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perfection of all creatures put together, are no more than God alone: The reaſon of it is, becauſe, if there be any perfection in creatures, it is but what God himſelfe hath put into them. What a man gives to another, is no addition to himſelfe, much leſſe is that which God gives man or Angel, any addition to God. God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and no addition can be made to infinite: When the creature doth moſt for us, the creature (of it ſelfe) doth nothing for us, <hi>God doth all in all &amp; by all.</hi> The creature doth you no more good at one time than at another, all the good which is done at any time, God doth it: So then, every way God hath no need of creatures. And it is our comfort, I am ſure it ought to be, that he hath not. He ſaith to <hi>wiſemen</hi> I have no need of your <hi>counſels;</hi> to <hi>rich men</hi> I have no need of your <hi>purſes;</hi> and to <hi>great men,</hi> I have no deed of your <hi>power;</hi> hee ſees all is vanity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If God truſt not Angels, let not us truſt in man; if he charges his Angels with folly, let not us adore the wiſedome of man. This diſcovery of imperfection in Angels, ſhould lay all creatures low before us, and take us off from confidence or boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in any arme of fleſh. To this ſenſe, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> proſecutes the argument in the following words to the end of the Chapter.

                  <p>Two things this Context holds forth to us, concerning the weakneſſe of man, in oppoſition to Angels.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It ſhewes that man is a <hi>materiall ſubſtance,</hi> ſo are not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Angels are ſpirits, ſpirituall ſubſtances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ſhewes us, that man is a <hi>mortall ſubſtance,</hi> ſo are not Angels, <hi>ſpirits die not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That, man is a materiall ſubſtance, is proved in the beginning of the 19. verſe, from thoſe words, <hi>He dwels in a houſe of clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That, man is a mortall ſubſtance, is implied in the former; That which is made of clay and duſt, muſt needes be brittle ware. But beſides that his mortality is implied in thoſe words, it is proved expreſly and in termes in the words following to the end of the Chapter.

                  <p>The body of man is called a houſe or building in two reſpects.

                  <p>Secondly, becauſe of the continuance of it, or the means by which it is ſupported: for, as it was at the firſt framed out of the earth, ſo it is ſtill ſupported and maintained by earth; earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, meat and drink with ſuch like accomodations, continue and repair this houſe from day to day, untill at laſt it be laid down in the duſt, and returne to earth again.

Mans foundation is but ſand or duſt: and the word ſignifies flying, light, unſtable, moveable duſt, ſuch as lies on the ſurface of the earth, and is plaid about with every puffe of winde, though ſome (I confeſſe) take the word not ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for this flying duſt, but for ſlimy duſt, or duſt moiſtned, which is ſlime.

                  <p>A ſecond thing we may take notice of from mans originall, which exceedingly advances the infinite wiſdome, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of God. Duſt and Earth are the matter out of which we are formed. But doth the countenance of man repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent duſt and earth? Could any one ſay, who had nothing to judge by, but the eye, that man was made of ſuch mean materials? What characters of Beauty and Majeſty ſit in his viſage? how unlike is he to his own parent, the Earth? Man hath received from God, not only an excellent fabrick or compoſure of body, but if you conſider it, the very matter of which the body is compoſed, is farre more excellent then earth or duſt. Take a piece of earth, or a handfull of duſt, and compare them with the fleſh of man, that fleſh is earth indeed, but that fleſh is farre better then meer earth. This ſhewes the power of the Creator, infinitely exceeding the power of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. A <hi>Goldſmith</hi> can make you a goodly Jewel, but then you muſt give him gold and precious ſtones of which to make it; he can put the matter into a hetter form, but he cannot make the matter better. The <hi>Engraver</hi> can make a curious Statue, exactly limb'd, and proportion'd to the life, out of a ruff piece, but the matter muſt be the ſame you put into his hands; if you give him Marble, it will be a <hi>Marble Statue,</hi> but he cannot mend the matter. Mans work <note place="margin">Materiam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabat opus.</note> often exceeds his matter, but mans work cannot make the matter exceed it ſelf. Now God took up <hi>a rude lumpe</hi> of earth, or ſubtile duſt, and he not only put that into an excellent form, but he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the matter alſo. Man is earth, but he is earth ſublimated and refined; <hi>Not only doth the forme exceed the matter, but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter formed exceeds the matter unformed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as this lifts up the wiſdome and power of God, ſo it ſhould humble and lay man low. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> improves this principle as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40455:80"/> an Argument to take down the ſpirit of <hi>Job</hi> from his ſuppoſed heights and ſelf-conceits. Surely thou art great in thy owne thoughts, when thou preſumeſt to enter a conteſt with God: But, look to thy Originall; ſuch towring, lofty, and aſcending thoughts would quickly be abated, if thou wouldeſt remember tha thou art but a clod of earth, a little refined clay, moving ſlime, enlivened duſt, breathing aſhes; did we ſpiritually look upon the matter of our bodies, it would take down the ſwelling of our ſpirits; when our ſpirits are like <hi>Jordan</hi> in the time of harveſt, overflowing all the banks of humility and moderation, this thought ſpiritualiz'd will bring us into our channels again, and recall us to our owne bounds and banks. Some Naturaliſts obſerve of the Bees, that when they are up and angry, do but throw a little duſt upon them, they are quiet and hive again. Certainly, when our imaginations are buzzing and humming in the aire, when thy are flying and mounting up to Heaven, not in holy aſpirings to God (which we ever ought) but in bold aſpirings againſt God, which we ſhould never dare, in ſuch a diſtemper of our ſpirits, if we could but caſt this duſt upon them, it would quiet and bring them in again.</p>
                  <p>Hath not man cauſe to lye as low in his thoughts, as that from whence he was extracted? ſhould not he be humbled to the duſt, who is duſt? Eſpecially, this earth ſhould be abaſed in all addreſſes to Heaven, in all our approaches unto God, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> Geneſis 18. 27. <hi>I have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, who am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> We ſhould never be ſo low in our own thoughts, as when we make uſe of our higheſt priviledges; and the nearer we are admitted to come to Heaven, the more ſhould we (for the magnifying of Free-grace, which makes this admiſſion) remember that we are but Earth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the body be but clay, and hath but a foundation of duſt, then doe not beſtow too much care and coſt upon your clay, upon your duſt. How many are there who beſtow much paines to trim up a vile body, and neglect a precious ſoule? Moſt uſually they who beſtow moſt paines upon this mortall houſe of clay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow leaſt about that immortal inhabitant. In an over cared for bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there ever dwels a neglected ſoul. You ſhall have a body clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſhed, and a ſoule all filth; a body neatly clothed and dreſt, with a ſoule all naked and unready; a body fed, and a ſoule ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; a body full of the creature, and a ſoule empty of Chriſt; theſe are poor ſoules indeed. That complaint of the Moraliſt againſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40455:80"/> 
                     <hi>Heathens,</hi> may be renewed againſt ſome <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they are buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt <hi>between the combe and the glaſſe, and troubled more at a diſorder in their haire, then at a diſorder in the Common-wealth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Inter' pectinem &amp; ſpeculum occupari.</hi> Sen.</note> (he ſaid, I ſay) <hi>then at a diſorder in the Church, or in their owne hearts.</hi> It is a ſad thing, that any who bear the name of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſhould ſpend much time betweene the <hi>combe and the glaſſe,</hi> and but little betweene <hi>Ordinance and Ordinance, betweene the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the Pulpit, betweene reading and hearing, betweene both, and holy meditation;</hi> the body is but a houſe of clay, it is but duſt, therefore be not ſo induſtrious for it. We uſually laugh at children when they are making Houſes of Clay, and Pies of Dirt. They whoſe care is thus over active for the body, are but <hi>children of a greater ſtature,</hi> and ſhew, they have ſo much more folly in their hearts then they, by how much they have more years over their heads, and are fooliſh about more ſerious matters then they. <hi>There is no child to the old child.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, ſeeing this houſe of clay is founded alſo in duſt, obſerve, that <hi>man is a very fraile, an unſteady, and an unſtable creature,</hi> every puffe muſt needs ſubject him to ruine. Look upon his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, it is nothing but duſt. When CHRIST <hi>(Math.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.)</hi> had finiſhed his Sermon upon the Mount, he compares his hearers to ſuch as build either upon the Rock, or upon the Sand, <hi>they that heare and doe not, are like a houſe built upon the ſand;</hi> and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of that houſe? when the rain deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, <hi>that houſe fell, and the fall thereof was great.</hi> A foundation of duſt or ſand cannot ſtand out one ſtorme. The houſe of mans body is walled and roofed with clay, and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd upon no better then duſt; the ſtrength of the Church (as was toucht before) is deſcribed by the matter of its foundation A Rock, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. And the new Jeruſalem (which as it is conceived to be the moſt pure ſtate of the Church here on earth, ſo it muſt be the ſtrongeſt) is ſet forth having twelve foundations, and they all of ſtone, and all thoſe ſtones moſt precious, and therefore moſt dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 19. The ſtrength and ſtability of that eſtate which the Saints ſhall inherit, when theſe houſes of earth are by death level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the earth (the ſtability (I ſay) of that eſtate) is deſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>a City which hath foundations (Heb.</hi> 11. 10.) He (namely <hi>Abraham) looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> When the Holy Ghoſt ſaith <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> who can tell how many they may be? we can eaſily tell
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40455:81"/> the feweſt they can be; <hi>two</hi> is the loweſt number; ſo that at leaſt this City hath a foundation upon a foundation. The foundation of Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe is laid upon the foundation of Gods eternall free love: here is foundation upon foundation. The City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove hath theſe foundations, and therefore we receive <hi>a City that cannot be ſhaken.</hi> I note theſe things, to ſhew by conſent of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the ſtability of any condition in alluſion to a building is expreſt by the ſtrength of its foundation Now, all our outward glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and excellency, our life, and all the pompe of it, hath ſcarce ſo much as deſerves to be called a foundation; a foundation of duſt hath only the name of a foundation. That <hi>Image</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> which typed out all the deſcents of worldly greatneſſe, had <hi>a head of gold, the breaſt and armes of Silver, the thighes of Braſſe, and the legs of Iron, but the feet were part of Iron and part of Clay.</hi> The feet are the foundation, and the feet of this Image ſpeak thus much to all the world, that all worldly pompe &amp; greatneſſe, all worldly power and majeſty muſt fall, for the image ſtands upon clay; and though it have a mixture of iron in the feet which is ſtrong, yet it ſhall not ſtand by the iron which is ſtrong, but fall and be broken by the clay which is weak. As it was in thoſe great Monarchies, into which the outward power of Nations and Kingdomes was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: ſo if you look upon any particular man, though you may conceive him to have a head of gold, armes and breaſt of ſilver, thighes of braſſe, and legs of iron, yet when you come to the feet, the foundation of the whole body, it is but duſt, which a ſmall ſtorm will diſſipate and blow away, The body of man hath ſo weak a foundation, that it is ſometime compared to that which hath no foundation, <hi>a Tabernacle,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) <hi>If the earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.

The body is but as the Cabinet, the ſoule is the Jewell; the body is but as the ſheath or the ſcabbard, the ſoule is as the knife or the ſword; You know when a man buyeth a ſword, he buyes a ſcabbard too, or when he buyes a knife, he buyes the ſheath too, yet he ſaith, this knife coſt me ſo much, or I gave ſo much for this ſword he makes no mention of the ſcabbard or of the ſheath; now the body is the ſheath or ſcabbard of the ſoule <hi>(Dan.</hi> 7. 15.) you have it expreſt ſo, <hi>I was grieved</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>in my ſpirit in the middeſt of my body,</hi> ſo we tranſlate it, but the Chaldee is (and ſo we have it in ſome Margents) <hi>in the middeſt of my ſheath; The ſoule is the blade, a blade of admirable mettle and temper; the body how beautifull ſoever by nature, or gay by art is but a velvet, or an emboſſed ſheath and ſcabbard:</hi> therefore at firſt, when God formed man out of the duſt of the earth, and had breathed into him the breath of life, the reſult of all is, <hi>and man became a living ſoule;</hi> it is not ſaid, man became a living body, though life was breathed into the body, and the body ſtood up and lived, yet the beſt part is named for all, the duſt and the clay are (as it were) quite forgotten in the ſtory, <hi>man became a living ſoule.</hi> And that may be a reaſon, why the fear of God and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <note place="margin">

How ſtrangely have ſome departed from this point of truth, which the Scripture every where writes as with a <hi>Sun-beame:</hi> who inſtead of making the ſoule to be the chiefe part of man, deny that man hath any ſuch part And whereas ſome (toucht at before) err'd on the right hand, ſaying,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40455:82"/> that Man was nothing but a ſoule: Theſe goe aſtray more, and more dangerouſly on the left hand, ſaying that Man hath no ſoule at all: An opinion, howſoever lately dreſt in ſome fineneſſe of wit, and ſubtilties of Philoſophy, yet in it ſelf ſo groſſe, ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to man, ſo contrary to this Text, and the whole tenour of the word of God, that I hope it is very mortal, and will ſhortly find a grave in every heart, but theirs, who have more reaſon to wiſh it, then to maintain it. I intend no diſpute about it, beyond the Argument before me, which if it be not demonſtrative (as many others from Scripture are) yet it carries (at leaſt) a faire probability, and an ingenuous ground; for how can man be ſaid to dwell in a houſe of clay, if he himſelf be nothing elſe but a houſe of clay? or how can the inhabitant and the houſe be in all, but one and the ſame?</p>

Our owne tranſlation which comes cleer to the letter of the Originall, is further to be looked into. <hi>They are cruſhed before the moth.</hi> It may have a three-fold interpretation, Firſt, before the moth, that is, before in time, or ſooner then the moth. How quickly is a moth cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? man may be cruſhed before it, ſooner then it is cruſht. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Before the moth,</hi> may be as much, as, in the preſence of the moth; as if he ſhould ſay, man thinks he is able to ſtand it out againſt a potent Adverſary, yea againſt God himſelfe; but alaſſe poore creature, he is not able to ſtand before a moth, or contend with a flye, if God arme any of them againſt him. Thirdly, <hi>They are cruſhed before the moth,</hi> that is, man is cruſht and torne, vext and worne out by a thouſand miſeries and troubles which attend his life, before ever the moth has to doe with him, before ever he lyes downe in the bed of death, before the moth, that is, for the moth to fret on, or as a companion for the wormes.</p>
                  <p>All theſe renderings, though they differ in words, come neer and meet in the ſame generall ſenſe, namely, <hi>An illuſtration of mans frailty.</hi> Take them firſt by way of ſimilitude, <hi>Man is cruſhed as it were with a moth,</hi> it notes thus much to us, <hi>That death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes us without noiſe,</hi> ſecretly and ſilently: To doe a thing as a moth, is to doe it ſilently and without noiſe. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 12. God himſelfe ſaith, <hi>that he will be as a moth unto Ephraim, and as a Lion,</hi> ver. 14. when he ſaith he will be as a Lion, it implieth open judgements, which come violently and viſibly, which come in, like thunder, roaring as a Lion upon them; But when he ſaith, <hi>I will be as a moth unto Ephraim,</hi> the meaning is, I will ſend ſilent and ſecret judgements upon you, which ſhall eate out your ſtrength, corrode your power, and blemiſh the beauty of your garments, and you ſhall not perceive it; Ye ſhall be undone, conſumed, and (as we ſpeak Proverbially) <hi>ye ſhall never know who hurt you.</hi> The open enemies of the Church are threatned with ſecret judgements, under this notion of a moth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 9. <hi>Loe they ſhall wax old as doth a garment, the moth ſhall conſume them.</hi> Againe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51. 6, 7. <hi>Feare ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings. For the moth ſhall eate them up like a garment, and the worme ſhall eate them like wool:</hi> that is, whereas, your enemies have made a great noiſe and clamour with their revilings
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40455:83"/> againſt you; I will come againſt them without noiſe, they ſhall periſh with as little clamour as a garment doth, that is eaten with moths. And thus the life of man is ordinarily conſumed (as it were) by a moth; ſickneſſes and diſeaſes enter ſecretly, into his houſe of clay, they lye in the frame and between the rafters of this houſe, ſucking up the ſpirits, and waſting the ſtrength, ſpending the heate, and drinking up the naturall moiſture of the body; we know not how we conſume, but we conſume; we know not how we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, but we decline; we dye, we know not how, but we dye: Is it not then as with <hi>a moth,</hi> creeping upon us, yea feeding upon us without noiſe?</p>
                  <p>Againe, Take it by way of ſimilitude, not as before <hi>actively or inſtrumentally,</hi> they are <hi>cruſhed as by a moth,</hi> or as a moth cruſhes; but <hi>paſſively or ſubjectively; They are cruſhed as a moth,</hi> that is, they are cruſhed as a moth is cruſhed, alluding to the eaſineſſe of cruſhing a moth; A moth is duſt as ſoone as you cruſh it the leaſt touch kills it; Man in his houſe of clay is ſo weake, that if God doe but touch him, he dies and falls to duſt; the Lord needs not bring his great Artillery, and make batteries againſt the body of man: the body of man is no ſuch <hi>ſtrong Fort or Bulwarke</hi> to ſtand out a long ſiege, or endure much aſſaulting and oppoſition; he is cruſhed as <hi>a moth betweene your fingers;</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> moſt humbly deprecates the ſtroake of God, which he ſaw comming, or felt as come, becauſe he was not able to beare it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 10. <hi>Remove thy ſtroake away from me, I am conſumed by the blow of thine hand,</hi> (Lord if thou ſtrike me thus I ſhall quickly conſume) And leaſt you ſhould think that <hi>Davids</hi> fleſh (he being a King) was tender and delicate, and ſo leſſe able to beare any hardſhip, therefore in the following words, he puts the caſe in generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>man</hi> or <hi>man-kind,</hi> Take the man <hi>whoſe ſtrength is as the ſtrength of ſtones, and his fleſh as braſſe;</hi> yet this man breakes and vaniſhes under the hand of God, ſo he affirmes, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. under this paſſive conſideration of <hi>a moth, When thou with rebukes doeſt correct man for iniquity, thou makes his beauty to conſume away like a moth</hi> (And then cloſes with that common axiome of mans mortality) <hi>ſurely every man is vanity,</hi> Selah.</p>
                  <p>Further, Man may well be ſaid to be cruſhed or die even as a moth, for as the garment breeds the moth, and then the moth eates the garment; ſo (beſides that power of God, or the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtroake of his hand, of which <hi>David</hi> ſpake) mans own
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40455:83"/> diſtempered body breeds ill humours they diſeaſes, and theſe breed death: As it was with <hi>Jonas</hi> gourd, ſo it is with us, we give life and ſuck to a worme in our own roots, which ſucks out our life, cauſing our leaves to fall, and our goodly branches ſuddenly to wither.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From that ſenſe, he is <hi>cruſhed before Arcturus,</hi> or as long as the Starres continue, Obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That, as mans ſtate is fraile and weake, ſo it will be, the for ever of this world.</hi> Doe not looke that ever there ſhall riſe up a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men, that ſhall have better houſes then houſes of clay, or houſes ſtronger built then our preſent buildings. As we are riſen up in our fathers ſtead, a generation of <hi>ſinfull men;</hi> ſo we are riſen up in our fathers ſtead, a generation of <hi>weake mortall men:</hi> and our children will ariſe in the ſtead of us their fathers, a generation of men, as mortall as we their fathers. Till the whole compages and courſe of nature be changed, man ſhall not exchange the infirmity of his nature, <hi>He ſhall never be without cruſhing ſickneſſes, till he is above them.</hi>

                  <p>This ſenſe teacheth us, <hi>That man is deſtroyable every moment.</hi> He waſts in one ſenſe, while he growes, and dies from the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his birth and comming into the world, to the evening of his returne and going out of the world: And not only ſo, but he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40455:84"/> is obnoxious to the violent aſſaults of death every day, and all houres of every day: From the morning when he riſes, to the evening when he goes to bed, he walkes among armies of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and within the Gunſhot of deſtruction. The Apoſtles ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of perils is true to this day. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>In perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of mine own countrymen, in perils by the Heathen, in perils in the City, in perils in the wilderneſſe, in perils in the ſea, in perils among falſe brethren:</hi> Every place is a peril, and every perſon a peril. Where can we goe, with whom can we meete, and not goe among or meete with perils? And doe not all theſe perils ſpeake deſtruction <hi>from morning to evening? Pauls</hi> experiences, both in regard of a natural, but eſpecially of violent death, brought forth theſe concluſions, which come full up to the point. <hi>I die daily,</hi> (1 Cor. 15 31.) <hi>in deaths often</hi> (2 Cor. 11. 23.) <hi>we are killed all the day long,</hi> (Rom. 8. 36.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take the words as a <hi>proverbiall ſpeech,</hi> by which the ſhorteſt time is ſignified. As <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 38. 12.) <hi>Hezekiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning, ſets forth his mortall ſickneſſe, threatning preſent death and cutting off, thus; <hi>Mine age is departed and removed from me as a ſheapheards tent; I have cut off like a weaver my life, he will cut me off with pining ſickneſſe, from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me,</hi> that is, either continually or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me, I am waſting perpetually: or <hi>before night,</hi> within the compaſſe of this day thou wilt deſtroy and make an end of me; theſe were the thoughts of my heart, when I was in the hands of that <hi>acute</hi> diſpatching diſeaſe. The Pſalmiſt, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 90. 5, 6,) deſcribes man as graſſe, <hi>in the morning it flouriſheth and groweth up, in the evening it is cut downe and withereth;</hi> that is, man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth but a very ſhort time. His life is but a ſpanne long, or but a day long. <hi>Jonahs</hi> Gourd came up in a night, and periſhed in a night; and man commeth up in the morning, and periſheth in the evening. The Naturaliſts ſpeake of a Fly they call <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> a creature of one day, which comes forth in the morning, is very active about noone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when the Sunne declineth, it declines too, and ſets, with the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Sunne. Man is an <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> a creature of one day; for howſoever his life conſiſteth of many dayes, &amp; is often lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out to many yeares, yet betweene morning and evening, or from morning to evening he is deſtroyed. The firſt ſtep he ſets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40455:84"/> the ſtage of the world, is a going out of the world; his aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the height of his natural perfection, hath in it a decent. One part of his life compared with another, is an increaſe, but the whole in reference to his end, is a decreaſe: his life is but a breathing death, life ſhortning as faſt as it lengthns, his life is death haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon him continually. A hand breadth is quickly meaſured: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 29. 5.) <hi>thou haſt made my dayes an hand breadth;</hi> nothing needs no time to paſſe it in; mans age in it ſelf is but little, and comparatively it is <hi>nothing;</hi> it fals under no calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the face of Eternity. <hi>Mine age is nothing before thee.</hi>

                  <p>But though the life of man be thus ſhort, and himſelf be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between a morning and an evening, yet death laſts long, <hi>they periſh for ever without any regarding.</hi>

                     <hi>For ever,</hi> is ſome time put for an infinite time, and ſome time for an indefinite time, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 25 <hi>The Lord God of Iſrael hath given reſt unto his people, that they may dwell in Jeruſalem for ever.</hi> And yet the Jewes are now ſo farre from dwelling in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> that they have ſcarce reſt or dwelling among any people. The like ſenſe of <hi>for ever,</hi> reade 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 12, 14. Yet further, <hi>for ever</hi> is put for the finite time of one mans life, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 12. <hi>He ſhall be my ſervant for ever,</hi> that is, <hi>as long as he lives. Pſal.</hi> 23. 6. <hi>I will dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever,</hi> that is, as long as I live. In the text before us, <hi>for ever,</hi> is as long as this world laſts; it notes the utmoſt terme of time, not (which is without terme) eternity. <hi>They periſh for ever,</hi> that is, they ſhall not live in this world any more; as <hi>(Job</hi> 14. 14.) <hi>If a man dye ſhall he live again?</hi> As if he had ſaid, man can dye but once; he cannot live againe, that is, in this world; ſhall he any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his houſe, to his wife and children to his riches or honours, and, ſhall he here againe enjoy ſuch an eſtate as he had before? That <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 103. 16.) explains it ſo, <hi>As for man his days are as graſs, as a flower of the field ſo he flouriſheth, for the winde paſſeth over</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:40455:85"/> 
                     <hi>it and it is gone, and the place thereof ſhall know it no more,</hi> that is, he ſhall never returne to that locall place, or civill place in which he lived; he ſhall not return to that place of magiſtracy or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrey, to that place of merchandizing or trading, of husbandry or handicraft, where he convers'd before. Thus his place will know him no more. Man dyes but once, and therefore when he dies, he is ſaid to dye for ever. There is a <hi>ſecond death,</hi> but it is only a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond condition of life.</hi> Some ſhall ſo live for ever, that they ſhall be dying for ever. The miſery of all men here, is, that they are dying while they live; the miſery of the damned hereafter, will be, that they are living while they dye. We ſee then, that as life is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall going out of the world, ſo from death there is no returning to the world, <hi>they periſh for ever:</hi> when once you die, you are dead for <hi>good and all</hi> (as we ſay) there's an end, in reſpect of any work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this world, whether naturall, civill, or ſpirituall. A dying man periſhes for ever from eating and drinking, from any outward content or pleaſure. When <hi>Barzillai</hi> was (as it were but) upon the borders of death and confines of the grave (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 25.) he beſpeaks <hi>David</hi> thus, who had invited him to Court, <hi>Can I taſte what I eat and what I drink?</hi> (and it followes) <hi>Can I any more heare the voice of ſinging-men and ſinging-women? Can I any more?</hi> as if he had ſaid, I am now nigh unto death, theſe delights are gone they are periſhed for ever, I can hardly taſte any thing I eat or drink; the pleaſant Voice or muſicall Inſtrument can I any more hear? much more then in death it ſelf are all theſe outward comforts periſhed, and will periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in reſpect of civill works, he that dyes, periſhes for ever; no more buying, or ſelling, or trading, or de aling, all theſe things are paſt, and paſt for ever. Yea, death puts an end to all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall workes, ſuch as were the Saints exerciſe and duty upon the earth, at the grave, there's an end of them alſo; a dying man periſhes for ever, in reſpect of repenting or believing, in reſpect of praying or hearing the word. Theſe are heavenly works, but the time for theſe is, while you are upon the earth, none of theſe labours are in Heaven or Hell, no nor in the grave whether thou goeſt, as the Preacher concludes <hi>(Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 9. 10.) Therefore <hi>(Iſay</hi> 38. 18.) <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his ſickneſs makes it one part of his ſuit to God, that he might be ſpared, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the grave cannot praiſe thee, they that go downe into the pit cannot hope for thy truth, the living, the living he ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day.</hi> To praiſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40455:85"/> God ſhall be the work of Saints for ever; and yet the Saints dying are truly ſaid periſh for ever, from praiſing God. All that praiſe ſhall ceaſe in death, which belong to the wayes of grace; and then ſuch praiſe begins as ſuits with glory, which is our end. That <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> means it of ſuch praiſe, and not of all praiſe, is cleare from his own words, Verſe 20. <hi>We will ſing my ſong to the ſtringed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, all the dayes of my life in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> that is, in the ordinances of thy publick worſhip. They that are in the houſe of the grave, cannot praiſe the Lord in his houſe. And though the praiſes of the Lord in Heaven, are tranſcendent, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then thoſe in his houſe on Earth; yet it is a higher act of grace to deſire to live to praiſe God, then to be willing to dye that we may praiſe him; becauſe in this we deny our ſelves moſt; <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God on earth is a work as well as a reward, but praiſing God in Heaven is a reward rather then a work.</hi> And we put forth the moſt ſpirituall acts of grace, when we cheerfully goe on with a work, which we know ſtands betweene us and the beſt part of our reward. But I returne to the Text.</p>

It is a truth, that the decayes and ruines of Nature, will at laſt exceed the repairs of Art; but this gloſſe hath little regard to the text, which we tranſlate well, <hi>They periſh without any regarding it,</hi> that is, <hi>none or very few regarding it.</hi> The <hi>negative</hi> is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely univerſall, excluding all, as if there were none in the world who take notice of the ſhortneſſe and frailty of mans life, or of his for ever periſhing condition.

                  <p>Obſerve hence, <hi>Few of the living regard how ſuddenly others do, or themſelves may dye.</hi> Till we ſee a friend gaſping and dying, till we ſee him bedewed with cold ſweats, and rackt with Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, till our <hi>eye thus affects our hearts,</hi> our hearts are ſeldome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſenſe of our mortality.

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:40455:86"/> adviſes to go to the houſe of mourning, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. <hi>It is better to goe to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of mirth, for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that is the way of all men</hi> (all muſt dye) <hi>and the living will lay it to heart,</hi> or the living will regard it. As if he had ſaid, the living ſeldom lay death to heart, till they come to the houſe of death: He ſeems to promiſe for the living, that then they wil: yet his undertaking is not ſo ſtrict, as if every man that goes to the houſe of mourning did certainly lay it to heart: but he ſpeaks probably, that if living man will at any time lay death to heart, then ſurely he will when he goes to the houſe of mourning. When will a man think of death, if not when he ſees death? and looks into that dark chamber of the grave? There are many who lay it to heart only then: for a fit at a Funerall, they have a paſſion of the heart about mortality. And very many have gone ſo often to the houſe of mourning, that they are growne familiar with death, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of thoſe meetings take off all impreſſions of mortality from their hearts. As we ſay of thoſe Birds that <hi>build &amp; rooſt in ſteeples,</hi> being uſed to the continuall ringing of the bels, the ſound diſquiets them not: or as thoſe that dwel near the fall of the river <hi>Nylus,</hi> the noiſe of the water deafens them ſo, that they minde it not. Many have been ſo often at the grave, that now the grave is worn out of their hearts; they look upon it as a matter of cuſtome and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for men to dye and be buried, and when the ſolemnity of death is over, the thoughts of death are over: as ſoone as the grave is out of their ſight, preparations for the grave are out of mind. It is ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 12.) that when <hi>Amaſa</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Joab, and lay wallowing in his blood</hi> in the midſt of the high way, every one that came by him <hi>ſtood ſtill,</hi> but anon <hi>Amaſa</hi> is removed out of the high way into the field, &amp; a cloth caſt upon him, &amp; then (the text ſaith) <hi>all the people went on after Joab.</hi> It is ſo ſtill, we make a ſtop at one that lyes gaſping and groaning, at one that lyes bleeding and dying, but let a cloth be throwne over him and he draw aſide, put into the grave, and covered with earth, then we goe to our buſineſſe, to trading and dealing, yea to coveting and ſinning, as if the laſt man (that ever ſhould be) were buried. Thus, men periſh for ever, without any regarding. If this kinde of periſhing were more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, or regarded by more, fewer would periſh. <hi>Thoughts of death ſpiritualliz'd have life in them: thoughts of death laid to the heart, are a good medicine for an evil heart.</hi> It followes,</p>

                  <p>This Verſe (as I noted in the begining) prevents an objection which might be made, as if man had wrong done him: and that it were too great a diminution to his honour, whom God made the chief creature in the inferiour world, and but little inferiour to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves, that he ſhould be looked upon only as a <hi>heape of duſt, or a lumpe of clay,</hi> as a mortall, momentany periſhing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; therefore he grants that man hath an excellency; but all the excellency that he hath, whether naturall or artificiall, bred in him, or acquired by him, as a man, when he goes, goes too, <hi>Doth not their excellency which is in them go away?</hi> or <hi>journieth not their excellency with them?</hi> as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates, alluding to our paſſing out of the world, as in a journey; when a man dies he takes a journey out of the world, he goes out for ever; and (ſaith he) doth not his excellency journey along with him? yes, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion affirmes it, when man goes, his excellency goes too. The word <hi>(Jether)</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>excellency,</hi> ſignifies primarily, a <hi>reſidue or a remaine,</hi> and that two ways. Firſt, a reſidue of perſons, <hi>Judges</hi> 7. 6. <hi>But all the reſt of the people bowed downe on their knees to drink water.</hi> So the vulgar underſtands it here. <hi>They who are left after them, ſhall be taken away from them:</hi> namely their heirs or poſterity. Secondly, it ſignifies a reſidue of things, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 17. 14. where deſcribing worldly men who have their portion in this life, he ſaith, <hi>their bellies are fill'd with hid treaſure, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo full of children, and leave the reſt of their ſubſtance to their babes.</hi> Thus others take it here.

Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> cals <hi>Reuben</hi> in regard of his primogeniture; <hi>the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power;</hi> yet blots him in the next Verſe, becauſe of his ſinne, <hi>thou ſhalt not excell, Gen.</hi> 49. 3, 4. This ſenſe of the word ſuits well with the ſcope of the text in hand. <hi>His excellency,</hi> that is, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth excell, or is beſt in him. But what is that? Some by his <hi>Excellency</hi> underſtand the <hi>ſoule;</hi> as if he had ſaid, that beſt part
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40455:87"/> of man, the ſoule, which may be oppoſed to clay and duſt before ſpoken of, <hi>that noble gueſt, that royall inhabitant</hi> of this houſe of clay goeth out when death enters. Death diſſolves the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſoule and body.</p>
                  <p>Or rather we may take excellency for any ſpeciall endowment; firſt of the body, as beauty or ſtrength. Secondly of the minde, as wit and knowledge, learning or skill. Thirdly, we may take it for thoſe worldly excellencies of riches, honour, or authority; when a man goeth out, all theſe excellencies which are in him, or which are about him, go out too. This excellency is the ſame which is called the <hi>goodlineſſe of man,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>(Eſay</hi> 40. 6.) <hi>The voice ſaid, cry, what ſhall I cry? All fleſh is graſſe, and all the goodlineſſe thereof is as the flower of the field.</hi> Not only is the fleſh, but the goodlineſs thereof fading alſo. So here, not only the houſe of clay and the foundation of duſt, but the excellency of it: all the adorning and poliſhing, the guilding and painting, the rich hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and precious furniture of this houſe go away.</p>
                  <p>Taking excellency here for the ſoule, then, we ſee wherein our excellency conſiſts <hi>As man was the principall part of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo the ſoule is the principall part of man. The conſtitution of the ſoule is mans naturall excellency, and the converſion of the ſoule is mans ſpirituall excellency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly obſerve, <hi>Death is the going away, or the departure of the ſoule from the body.</hi> Death is called ſometime <hi>a departure</hi> of body and ſoule out of the world, <hi>Now letteſt thou thy ſervant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace</hi> (ſaith old <hi>Simeon, Luke</hi> 2.) <hi>Man goes to his long home, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>I go the way of all fleſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, and I goe away,</hi> ſaith <hi>our Lord Chriſt</hi> of his death. Death is alſo called a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the ſoule from the body. The death of <hi>Rachel</hi> is thus deſcribed, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 35. 18. <hi>And it came to paſſe, that as her ſoule was in departing, for ſhe dyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the other interpretation, which I rather inſiſts upon. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that in death all a mans naturall and outward excellency whatſoever, leaves him and departs from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 16. <hi>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his houſe is increaſed;</hi> why? <hi>for when he dyeth he ſhall carry nothing away with him, his glory ſhall not deſcend after him;</hi> though a man have an <hi>excellent out-ſide,</hi> a great ſtock of riches, beauty and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, though he have excellent <hi>linings</hi> of wiſdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet all ends as to him, when he ends, and therefore <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:40455:87"/> concludes <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 39.) <hi>Man at his beſt ſtate, or in his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity.</hi> The excellencies that are in him goe away, <hi>in that day all his thoughts periſh,</hi> his counſels and his projects pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with him. One of the ancients ſtanding by <hi>Caeſars Tomb,</hi> (who was one of the moſt accompliſht men in the world, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, civill, and morall excellencies; learned, valiant, noble, rich and powerfull,) he (I ſay) ſtanding by <hi>Caeſars Tomb,</hi> wept and cried out, <hi>where is now the flouriſhing beauty of Caeſar? what's</hi>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40455:88"/> he, by all thoſe conſiderations of my naturall conſtitution, I cannot bring my heart to be ſo ſenſible of my frailty, as I ought to be; therefore he turnes himſelfe to God, <hi>Lord make me to know this thing.</hi> Here is our wiſdom, when we ſeek to God to ſpiritualize na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſiderations, and make them effectuall for the attaining of this wiſdom, the knowing of our end, and the meaſure of our days.</p>
                  <p>But is it not ſome ignorance of our duty no petition for the knowledge of our end? May we deſire to know what God hath no where promiſed to reveale?

Thus to know our end, how <hi>ſoone ceaſing</hi> (as one tranſlates) ſhort lived and brittle ware we be; Thus to know, how defective we are (as the Greeke renders it) or what we lack, namely to the end of our dayes, is above the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of any creature.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE five firſt verſes of this Chapter, containe the fourth Argument, by which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> goes on to convince <hi>Job</hi> of ſinful hypocriſie. And the conviction is made two wayes, from a two-fold compariſon. Firſt, He compares <hi>Job</hi> to the Saints, and finds him unlike to them: Secondly, He compares <hi>Job</hi> to the wicked, and finds him like to them; if ſo, then <hi>Job</hi> muſt needs be a hypocrite, who had carried it faire all the while in the world, for a <hi>great profeſſor,</hi> and yet when he comes to the tryall, was unlike all the Saints, and moſt like the wicked of the world. The firſt Argument may be thus framed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is not a juſt or a holy man, who in his affliction is altogether unlike holy and juſt men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Job, <hi>thou in thy affliction art altogether unlike holy and juſt men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore thou art not a holy or a juſt man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The propoſition is implied: The Minor or the Aſſumption, is in the firſt verſe, <hi>Call now, if there be any that will anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Inquire as much as thou wilt, thou ſhalt find none among the Saints like thy ſelfe; they, who have been ſomewhat like thee (of whom thou ſhalt find but few) in the troubles which thou haſt borne, even thoſe thou wilt find altogether unlike thee, in bearing thoſe troubles. Scarce any of the godly ever ſuffered ſuch things as thou haſt done, but none of the godly ever did ſuch things in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
                  <p>As he argues him in the firſt verſe of hypocriſie, by his unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Saints; ſo in the next words, he argues him of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, by his likeneſſe to the wicked: His firſt argument for this, lyes in the ſecond verſe, and in the three following verſes there lyes a ſecond argument to confirme the ſame point; He attempts
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40455:90"/> to prove <hi>Job</hi> like a foole or a wicked man, two wayes.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In his manner of ſuffering.</item>
                     <item>2. In the matter of his ſuffering.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt (ſaith he) thou art like a foole, or like a fooliſh man, like the worſt of men, in the manner of thy carriage under ſufferings; The argument may be framed thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that behaveth himſelfe like a foole, or like a wicked man while he is in trouble, is a man either openly wicked, or groſſely hypocriticall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Job, <hi>thou behaveſt thy ſelfe, like a fooliſh or a wicked man in thy troubles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore thou art wicked, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Aſſumption, or Minor Propoſition, is in the ſecond verſe, <hi>Wrath killeth the fooliſh, and envy ſlayeth the ſilly one.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Thou pineſt, rageſt and vexeſt thy ſelfe under they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, after the rate of fooliſh and ſilly ones, that is, ſinfull and wicked ones.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He would prove <hi>Job,</hi> to be a hypocrite, becauſe his ſufferings for the matter of them, were like the judgements which God uſes to powre forth upon wicked und ungodly men; and that argument may be thus framed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wicked men flouriſh a while, and then ſudden deſtruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth upon them, they and their children, and their whole eſtates are ſwallowed up in a moment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Job, <hi>thou having flouriſhed a little while, waſt ſuddenly ſurpriſed and ſwallowed up by judgements, thou, thy eſtate, thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, all devoured and conſumed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore thou art a wicked man, a very hypocrite;</hi> God hath dealt with thee as he uſes to deale with his enemies, and therefore thou art not his friend.</p>
                  <p>This is the Logicke of the context, or the reaſons couched in them, whereby <hi>Eliphaz</hi> would convince <hi>Job</hi> of ſinne; By this, a generall light is let into the whole Context.</p>
                  <p>Now, we will conſider the words, and open their ſenſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
                  <q>Call now if there be any that will anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne?</q>
                  <p>Interpreters vary much about the meaning of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some of the Jewiſh Writers, looke upon theſe words, as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40455:90"/> proceeding from hight and pride of ſpirit in <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> as if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to talke with <hi>Job</hi> any longer about the buſineſſe; as if he looking upon <hi>Job</hi> as no match for him, in point of argument, bids him looke out an <hi>Angel</hi> or a <hi>Saint</hi> to grapple with him in theſe diſputes, and ſee if he could find any one of thoſe, who would undertake for him as an <hi>Advocate,</hi> or be his <hi>Second,</hi> foraſmuch as himſelfe was ſo unable to defend his cauſe, or juſtifie what he had done; <hi>Call now if there be any that will anſwer thee,</hi> that is, <hi>anſwer for thee,</hi> or to which of the Saints wilt thou turne for help, to patronize or plead thy cauſe? But I ſhall paſſe that.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others of the <hi>Jewiſh writers</hi> make the ſenſe out thus, as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid with <hi>Paul</hi> in the point of the Lords Supper (1 Cor. 11. 24.) <hi>That which I have delivered unto you, I have received of the Lord,</hi> ſo, that which I delivered unto thee in my former argument, I received from the Lord in a viſion, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto me from Heaven: now, doe thou try whether thou canſt learne any thing from Heaven, or from the Saints upon the earth (who are inſtructed to and for the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven)</hi> which may anſwer my arguments, or confute the reaſons which I have broughc againſt thee. I had a viſion from Heaven, now call thou to Heaven, and ſee if thou canſt have any anſwer from thence; Turne alſo to the Saints, to any Saint upon the earth, and ſee what they will anſwer thee, I believe thou wilt not find one amongſt them all, differing in judgement from <hi>me,</hi> or from that <hi>Oracle,</hi> with <note place="margin">Nemo tibi pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vè corrupteq. de his rebus iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicanti patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus aderit, nemo qui tibi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeat, tibi ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, Others take the words as an <hi>Ironie,</hi> as a deriſion, or ſcorne put upon <hi>Job</hi> by <hi>Eliphaz;</hi> As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had mocked him thus; Thou haſt handled the matter well, thou haſt carried thy ſelfe ſo, in the dayes of thy peace and proſperity, that now when thou art in trouble, thou mayeſt call long enough, and cry till thy throat akes and thy ſpirits be ſpent, and yet have none to anſwer thee, none to ſpeake a word to thee, or to doe thee any good; though thou cry to all the Saints, and ſend to all thy friends round about thee, yet in this day none will heare or regard thee: Thou wilt find thy ſelfe forſaken of all, no man will give thee any aſſiſtance, or take any care of thy condition. Juſt, as <hi>Elijah</hi> brake forth in holy ſcorne againſt the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> (1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 27.)
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40455:91"/> when they were crying out to their <hi>Idol</hi> for helpe, and a ſigne by fire, <hi>Cry aloud</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>cry aloud;</hi> he bad them cry aloud, yet he knew the Idol was deafe and dumbe, and could neither heare their cry, nor give them anſwer; So <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeemes to ſpeake to <hi>Job, Cry aloud</hi> now, to this, to that Saint, with whom thou art acquainted here on earth, or cry to Heaven, cry to God himſelfe; call this way, call that, if any will anſwer thee, either <hi>God</hi> above, or <hi>Saint</hi> below, thou ſhalt not find here or there any to aſſiſt, any to releeve thee. And ſo he ſeems to allude to that juſt retaliation of God, who uſually turnes his eare from their cry in a day of trouble who have turned their eares from his counſels, in the dayes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; As <hi>(Prov</hi> 1.)

                  </p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, Moſt of the Popiſh writers, buſie themſelves much to ground invocation of Saints, &amp; the interceſſion of Saints for us, upon this text: As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had directed <hi>Job</hi> to cry to the Saints departed; <hi>Call now if there be any that will anſwer,</hi> and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne? what Saint wilt thou chooſe for thy patron or helper in this ſad condition? So they teach and practiſe, having appointed a particular Saint in the <hi>Kalender</hi> of the yeare, to the help of every particular affliction in their lives, and to theſe they turne themſelves in every diſtreſſe: They have a Saint for the ſea, and a Saint for the land, a Saint for the fire, and a Saint for the water, a Saint for each diſeaſe of the body, and for each diſaſter in the family: To ſome of theſe they ſuppoſe <hi>Job</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to have recourſe, for ſuccour and comfort in his troubles. And yet they are divided in opinion, &amp; give a double ſenſe about it. Firſt, As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had thus beſpoken him; <hi>If thou doeſt not give credit unto me, nor believe what I have ſpoken was revealed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Aquinus in loc.</note> 
                     <hi>from God, then call thou thy ſelfe upon God, and try whether he will not give thee ſome anſwer, and reſolve thy doubt: Or if by reaſon of thine own unworthyneſſe, thou canſt not obtaine an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate anſwer at the hand of God, then turne thee to ſome of the Sainrs, that by their mediation thou maiſt receive light from God, to aſſure thee about my viſion, whether it were ſent from Heaven or no.</hi> Secondly, Others interpret it more largely, as if <hi>Eliphas</hi> perceiving <hi>Job</hi> to be brought to ſome light and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his ſins, and now to thirſt after the pardon of them:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40455:91"/> he in theſe words, exhorts him to call upon, and cry unto God for pardon, if perhaps he himſelfe would vouchſafe to anſwer; But in caſe ſhame did ſo cover his face, and guilt ſo ſtop his mouth, that he could not ſpeake unto God immediately, then he adviſeth him to pray in aide, from ſome of the Saints departed, who might manage this ſute, and intercede for him at the throne of grace. The groſſeneſſe of this interpretation is ſuch, as carries a ſelfe-refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it, and therefore I ſhall not need to ſtay long, about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing of it. Neither will I ſtay to argue againſt that groundleſſe, uſeleſſe Doctrine in generall, <hi>The invocation of Saints departed,</hi> Which finds no letter of command or direction, no letter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or acceptation, no letter of example or practice, for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the whole Booke of God. But is a reproach to the Saints, &amp; a diſhonour to God, whoſe Name and incommunicable Title is, <hi>The God hearing prayers, and therefore to him ſhall the deſires of all fleſh come,</hi> and if all to him, then who to Saints or Angels? Only <hi>He</hi> can be the object of our prayer who is the object of our faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>How ſhall they call on him, on whom they have not believed?</hi> To whom we pray, upon him we muſt believe Saints departed, are not to be believed upon, how then ſhall they be called on?</p>
                  <p>But, to leave the queſtion, I ſhall only touch two things, to ſhew how wide they are in this expoſition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The confeſſed Doctrine of <hi>Popery</hi> tells us, that, before Chriſts comming in the fleſh, and his reſurrection from the grave, all the Saints departed were in <hi>Limbus,</hi> a place which they have framed and built up in their own fancies, as the common receptacle of all thoſe, who died in the faith of Chriſt, before Chriſt died; Therefore, they tell us (to eke out the ſtory) That as <hi>Chriſt</hi> went downe into <hi>Hell,</hi> the place of the damned, to ſtrike terrour into the Devils, ſo he went into this <hi>Limbus,</hi> thence to deliver the fathers from that priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carry them up with himſelfe into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now this being their Tenet, how ſenſeleſſe is it, for them, to ground their opinion, of invocation of Saints, upon any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the old Teſtament? and therefore it is ſo, to ground it upon this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we conſider theſe words we may as well ſeek for fire in the bottome of the Sea, as for the invocation of Saints in this Text, for here is no ſuch thing ſpoken of; and if any thing ſounds that way, it is rather to condemne praying to Saints, then any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it: for <hi>call now if there be any that will anſwer thee,</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:40455:92"/> carries this ſenſe rather; call now, for there is none to anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne? that is, none among <note place="margin">

The life of Chriſt is a faire copy indeed, a copy without any blot, or uneven letter in it; For, He alſo is <hi>The Holy one.</hi> Chriſt is not only <hi>The principle of holineſſe,</hi> but alſo <hi>The patterne of holineſſe</hi> to his people; <hi>they that ſay they abide in him, muſt walke even as he walked;</hi> His workes, (excepting thoſe which were miraculous and workes of mediation between God and us) are our rule, as well as his word, Heb. 12. 2. <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, &amp;c.</hi> words of neere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance with thoſe in the text, <hi>to which of the Saints wilt thou turne thee?</hi> Looke to Jeſus; when you are in ſufferings and have a race of patience to run, let your eye alwayes be upon Chriſt, and draw the lines of your carriage, both in your ſpirits and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, according to what you ſee in Him, <hi>Looke to Him:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Conſider him that endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners.</hi>

                  <p>Which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21.) gives us in plaine termes, <hi>For even hereunto were ye called, becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps:</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:40455:94"/> We muſt follow his ſteps both in the matter and in the manner of our ſufferings; therefore Chriſt ſaith; <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learne of me,</hi> Mat. 11. 29. Chriſt calls it his yoke (it is a yoke of affliction as well as a yoke of inſtruction) And he calls it <hi>his yoke,</hi> not only becauſe, he, as a Lord layes it upon the necks of others, but becauſe, he, as a ſervant bore that yoke himſelfe; therefore he ſaith, <hi>Take my yoke upon you and learne of me,</hi> that is, not only take my yoke upon you for the matter, but learne of me for the manner, how to beare that yoke. Beſides theſe grand leading, uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring examples of God and Chriſt, the examples of the Saints are alſo commended to our imitation, both in doing and in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. <hi>Whatſoever things were written</hi> (and examples were written) <hi>aforetime, were written for our inſtruction.</hi> Why hath the Holy Ghoſt ſet ſo many pens a worke, to write the lives of the Saints? why hath he kept a record of them in his own book, but for direction to his people in after-times. The Lord hath not regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred any one act of the Saints, but is uſefull for us. The acts of <hi>Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Samuel, David, are full of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Divinity.</hi> The ſufferings and troubles of theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are full (if I may ſo ſpeake) of <hi>pathical Divinity:</hi> As the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> his counſell doth more then intimate <hi>(James</hi> 5. 10.) <hi>Take my brethren the Prophets who have ſpoken in the Name of the Lord, for an example of ſuffering affliction and of patience;</hi> Hence thoſe antient Saints and believers <hi>(Heb.</hi> 12. 1.) are called <hi>a cloud of witneſſes;</hi> A cloud, becauſe there is a directive or a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vertue in them; As there was a cloud that went before the children of Iſrael in the day to leade them, ſo this cloud of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, leads us up and downe the wilderneſſe of our ſorrowes, and in the darke night of our ſufferings. Turne you to the Saints, to that cloud of witneſſes, eye them, and ſee what becomes you in ſad times; They have ſuffered joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you likewiſe, if you come into the hands of ſpoilers. They li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith in the midſt of a thouſand deaths, live you likewiſe by faith in death, when ever you come into the hand of that king of terrors. And when at any time your own hearts or the wayes of others are out of courſe, check and chide them for and from thoſe diſorders, by ſending them to the practiſe of the Saints. <hi>Looke to the Saints,</hi> from which of the Saints have you learned to be proud and high minded? from which of the Saints have you learned to be earthly and covetous? from which of the Saints
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40455:94"/> have you learned to ſeek and ſet up your ſelves, or to be impatient under the hand of God? <hi>That man hath reaſon to ſuſpect he hath done ill, who doth that, which a good man never did, or ever repented the doing of it.</hi> Obſerve further;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When God forſakes a man, all the Saints on earth forſake him too. Eliphaz</hi> lookes upon <hi>Job,</hi> as a man forſaken of God, and then he bids him get help if he could among the Saints. He that oppoſes God, ſhall be oppoſed by all who are Gods. There is the ſame mind in the ſervants of Chriſt, which is in Chriſt their Maſter. They love where and whom he loves, they hate whom he hates, they are aſhamed of thoſe, of whom Chriſt is aſhamed; If God reject a man, the Saints will not undertake or anſwer for him. So much of the firſt Argument, ranking <hi>Job</hi> with the wicked, becauſe (as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> thought) he could not find any in the rank of Saints like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument riſes to a like conviction, becauſe, (in the ſame mans opinion) he might eaſily ſee himſelfe ſo like the wicked.</p>

He will be angry with the Sunne, if it ſhine hotter then he would have it, and with the winds, if they blow harder then he would have them, and with the clouds, if they raine longer then ſerves his turne.

                     <hi>Wrath kills this fooliſh man.] Wrath</hi> may be taken here two woyes, either for the wrath of God, or for the wrath of man.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40455:95"/> wrath is a long anger; when a man is ſet upon't, when his ſpirit is ſteeped and ſoak't in anger, then 'tis wrath. <hi>Eſau</hi> raked up the burning coales of his anger in the aſhes, till his Fathers Funerall, <hi>The time of mourning for my father will ſhortly come, then will I ſlay my brother.</hi> But our word rather notes, a ſervent heate and <note place="margin">

The ſenſe is very ſuitable to this of <hi>Eliphaz, wrath ſlayeth the fooliſh,</hi> or wrath makes him melt away, it melts his greaſe with chafing, as we ſay, of a man furiouſly vext; Hence that deplorable condition of the damned, who are caſt out of the preſence of God for ever, is deſcribed by <hi>weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth;</hi> which imports not onely paine, but extreame vexing at, or in themſelves.

                     <hi>Wrath killeth, &amp;c.]</hi> But how doth wrath kill a fooliſh man? his wrath ſometimes drawes his ſword and kils others: but is his wrath as a ſword to kill himſelfe? Many like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> in their anger have ſlaine a man; but that the anger of a man ſhould ſlay himſelfe, may ſeeme ſtrange? The paſſion of vvrath is ſuch an engine, as recoyles upon him that uſes or diſcharges it. As <hi>the deſire of the ſlothfull killeth him,</hi> Prov. 21. 25. ſo, the wrath of a fooliſh man kils him: that place enlightens this; how comes deſire to ſtay the ſlothfull? thus; A man ſlothfull in action is full of deſires and quick in his affections after many good things: he would faine have them, he longs for them: but the man is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame lazie, that he will not ſtirre hand or foot to get the things which he deſires, and ſo he pines away with <hi>wiſhing and woulding,</hi> and dies with griefe, becauſe deſire is not ſatisfied. So, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, wrath is ſaid to ſlay a man; firſt, becauſe it thruſts him head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon ſuch things, as are his death; he runnes wilfully upon his own death, ſometimes by the dangerouſneſſe of the action, whence caſuall ſuddaine death ſurpriſes him; ſometime by the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the action, which brings him to a legall or judiciary death. Secondly, his wrath is ſaid to kill him, becauſe his wrath is ſo vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40455:96"/> to him, that it makes his life a continuall death to him, and at laſt ſo wearieth him out, and waſts his ſpirits, that he dyes for very griefe: and ſo at once commits a three-fold murder; Firſt he murders <hi>him intentionally,</hi> againſt whom he is wroth: Secondly, he, <hi>really,</hi> murders his own body; and thirdly, he, <hi>meritoriouſly,</hi> murders his ſoule for ever, except the Lord be more mercifull, then he hath been wrathfull, and the death of Chriſt heal thoſe wounds, by which he would have procured the death of others, and hath (as much as in him lies) procured his own.</p>

God doth (let it be taken in holy reverence) tole men on by promiſes, and deceive them graciouſly into the Goſpell. <hi>(Hoſ.</hi> 2. 14.) <hi>I will allure her and bring her into the wilderneſſe.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by perſwaſions men are often deceived and ſeduced to evill, therefore the word ſignifies alſo to deceive and beguile, as well as to perſwade; and in the paſſive to be beguiled and deceived; Hence, the word in the text is derived, which we tranſlate <hi>a ſimple one,</hi> or a man that will eaſily be perſwaded &amp; led by another, a ſequatious
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40455:96"/> or eaſie man, whom you may carry with a mouth full of good words, and faire promiſes, whether you will. Yet, we finde this word <hi>(Pſal</hi> 116. 6.) uſed in a good ſenſe, for a man without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full guile and craft, a ſimple, honeſt, plaine-hearted man, <hi>The Lord preſerveth the ſimple.</hi> But here and often elſe-where it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in an ill ſence, for a man without ſence and reaſon, without heart and ſpirit, a man that cannot in any competency judge of things, or make out his way, but is meerly led, and lives upon the opinion and judgement of another: To ſuch <hi>wiſdome cryeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and uttereth her voyce in the ſtreets, how long yee ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity,</hi> Prov. 1. 20, 22. <hi>This ſilly one envie ſlayeth;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exiguo animo &amp; abjecto ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu.</note> He is out of his wits already, and a little matter will put him out of his life: <hi>Envy ſlayeth him,</hi> that is, a ſimple man looking upon the proſperity and bleſſings of God upon his neighbour, will needs afflict himſelfe: he lookes upon himſelfe, as having loſt all, if that man gaine: he fals, if his brother ſtands, and <hi>can with more eaſe die miſerably, then ſee another live happily.</hi> In this ſenſe it is, <hi>That envie kils the ſilly one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeakes of theſe two, the fooliſh and the ſimple one, and characters them, as dying by the hand of theſe two luſts, <hi>wrath and envie</hi> is, becauſe he conceived all <hi>Jobs</hi> troubled, and (as he thought) muddy complaints in the third Chapter, aroſe from theſe two impure and filthy ſprings, <hi>wrath and envie,</hi> from proud wrath, and impotent envie; he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as angry and diſpleaſed, yea as enraged, becauſe God had dealt ſo ill with him; and he ſuppoſed he ſaw him pale and wanne, eaten up and pined with envie, becauſe others were ſo well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his friends enjoyed health &amp; lived in proſperity round about him. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Thou art wroth at thy owne povertie, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſores, and thou art envious at our plentie, health and eaſe.</hi> And may not <hi>folly and ſimplicitie,</hi> challenge that man for <hi>Theirs,</hi> whoſe ſpirit thus reſents, either his own evils, or his neighbours good? Obſerve hence,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Every wicked man, is a fooliſh, a ſilly man;</hi> Sinne is pure folly, In the <hi>Proverbs</hi> all along, wickedneſſe is the Interpretation of fooliſhneſſe. It is folly to take braſſe Counters for gold, and to be pleaſed with Bugles more then with Diamonds. When an <hi>heyre</hi> is impleaded for an <hi>Ideot,</hi> the Judge commands an apple, or a counter, with a peece of gold to be ſet before him, to try which he will take; if he takes the apple or the counter, and leaves the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40455:97"/> gold, he is then caſt for a foole, and unable to mannage his eſtate, for he knows not the value of things, or how to make a true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Wicked men are thus fooliſh and more, for when bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and diamonds, counters and gold are before them, they leave the diamonds and the gold, and pleaſe themſelves with thoſe toyes and bables; when (which is infinitely more ſottiſh) Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell, life and death are ſet before them, they chuſe hell ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Heaven, and death rather then life; they take the meane, tranſitory, trifling things of the world, before the favour of God, the pardon of finne, a part in Jeſus Chriſt, and an inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints in light All the wiſdome of wicked men, is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in their owne conceits. And <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>there is more hope of a foole then of ſuch,</hi> that is, of thoſe, who are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their owne failings, and are willing (as the Apoſtle directs) <hi>to become fooles that they may be wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 18. Opinion in it ſelfe is weake, but ſelf-opinion is very ſtrong; even the ſtrongeſt of thoſe ſtrong-holds, and the higheſt of thoſe high Towers, which the ſpirituall warre, by thoſe weapons which are mightie through God, is to oppoſe and caſt down: which, till they are caſt down, theſe fooles are impregnable, and will not be led captive unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>That to vex and to be angerie at the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that fall upon us, or at the hand which ſends them, is a high point of folly and of ignorance.</hi> Wrath and diſcontent ſlay the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, ſuch are at once, twice ſlain, ſlain with the wrath of God, and with their own.</p>
                  <p>To die thus, is to die like a foole indeed. For firſt, this wrath of man ſprings from his ignorance of God: Man would not be angry at what the Lord doth, if he knew he were the Lord, and may doe what himſelfe pleaſes. <hi>The ground of anger is a ſuppoſition of wrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This wrath of man ſprings from ignorance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. He cannot be angry with any croſſe, who rightly knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt to be a creature.</p>
                  <p>This notion of our ſelves teaches us that leſſon of humility, to be ſubject to the will of our Creatour. The law of our creation cals us to all paſſive obedience, as well as unto active, as much and as quietly to ſuffer, as to doe the will of God. But eſpecially, if a man did fully know himſelfe to be a ſinfull creature, he would not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40455:97"/> be angry; yea, he would lay a charge upon his mouth, not to utter a word, and a charge upon his heart not to utter a thought againſt what the Lord doth with him. <hi>I will beare the Indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 9. As if ſhe had ſaid the remembrance of my ſinne takes away all pleading, much more all quarrelling, in how angry a poſture ſoever the Lord ſets himſelfe to afflict me: And therefore my ſpirit is reſolved, that becauſe my fleſh hath ſinned, my fleſh ſhall beare the indignation of the Lord. <hi>He that knowes what it is to ſinne, knowes that all ſufferings l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſe then ſinne.</hi> If a man were convinced of this, that, what he beares is leſſe then his ſinne deſerves, he would beare it, with thanks, not with complaints. <note place="margin">Iraſcitur, quia omnia ſibi cebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>at.</note> Yea he would ſay, that, as he hath deſerved all theſe and more then all theſe ſtroakes, ſo he hath need of them. The bundle of folly in his heart cals for a bundle of rods upon his backe and he ſees want of correction might have been his undoing. Therefore to be angry with affliction, argues a man ignorant of himſelfe as a creature, much more as a ſinfull creature. Once more the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch wrath appeares to the eye of nature and common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe this wrath brings no eaſe or remedy at all to thoſe wounds, but rather makes them more painfull, if not remedileſſe. It is an argument of folly to doe a thing, whereby we cannot helpe our ſelves, but it is folly and madneſſe to doe that which hurts, which makes our wound feſter and our diſeaſe grow deſperate. Did any man ever eaſe himſelfe by fretting or raging under the croſſe? How many have made their croſſe more heavie upon them, by raging at it? A mans owne wrath, is heavier to him then his croſſe. <hi>A ſtone is heavie, and ſand weightie, but a fooles wrath is heavier then them both,</hi> Prov. 27. 3. A fooles wrath is very heavie to others, but it is heavieſt to himſelfe. The text is expreſſe for it, which may be a third obſervation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be angry and diſcontent at Gods judgements is more deſtructive to us, then the judgements themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wrath and judgements of God afflict onely, but your owne wrath deſtroyes; wrath ſlayes the fooliſh. Probably God came onely to correct you, but wrath kils you. The wrath of man is a paſſion but it is very active upon man, and eats up the ſpirit which nurſes and brings it forth: Frowardneſſe and anger are at once our ſinne and our torment. He that is angry when God ſtrikes, ſtrikes himſelfe, whereas humble ſubmiſſion to the blow, turnes it into a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40455:98"/> kiſſe or an embrace, and they that ſit downe quietly and believing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under any evill, beare it at preſent with more eaſe, and in the end, find it in the inventory of their goods. So <hi>David, It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi> Fourthly note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That to envie another mans good or proſperity is an argument of the worſt ſimplicitie.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Envy ſlayeth the ſilly one.]</hi> Envie is a common theame, I will not ſtay upon it; but ſhall onely give you two reaſons to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the ſilly ſimplicity of an envious perſon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The good of another is not thy hurt, thou haſt not the leſſe, becauſe another hath more. <hi>Leah's</hi> fruitfulneſſe was no cauſe of <hi>Rachels</hi> barrenneſſe. Thy portion is not impaired by thy brothers increaſe; thou haſt thy ſhare, and he hath but his; how ſilly a thing then is it to envie him, that hath much, vvhen as, his having much is not the cauſe why thou haſt little. Againe, this troubling thy ſelfe that others have more, will not get thee any more; envie never brought in earnings or encreaſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man of wiſedome will make all the good of another his good. Take away envie, and that vvhich is mine, is thine, and if I take away envie, that vvhich is thine, is mine. To have a heart to bleſſe God for his bleſſings upon another, is it ſelfe a great bleſſing, and gives thee likewiſe a part in thoſe bleſſings. Thus we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the joyes and comforts, the favours and deliverances, the <note place="margin">Tolle invidiam &amp; quod meum eſt, tuum eſt, &amp; ſi ego tollam it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quod tuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt meum eſt.</note> health and peace, the riches and plenty, the gifts, yea and the very graces of all thoſe, in vvhoſe graces and gifts, plenty and riches, peace and health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We can really and cordially rejoyce. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as an envious man ever ſtands in his own light, and cannot rejoyce in his own mercies, for grieving at his Brothers.</p>
                  <p>So farre of the ſecond part of the argument, whereby <hi>Eliphaz</hi> would convince <hi>Job</hi> of wickedneſſe, his likeneſſe to the wicked in bearing of, or rather fretting againſt his troubles.</p>

                  <p>TWo parts of the fourth argument were cleared in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſes. In theſe three <hi>Eliphaz</hi> argues further, to the ſame effect. His argument is grounded upon his own experience, which had ſhewed many examples of fooliſh men, like <hi>Job</hi> (as he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) both in his riſing and in his falling, in his good days and in his evill. <hi>I have ſeen the fooliſh taking root, and ſuddenly I curſed his habitation,</hi> &amp;c. The argument may be thus framed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fooliſh men flouriſh a while and then come to certaine and ſudden deſtruction, they and their children and their eſtates are all cruſhed and ſwallowed up.</hi>

                     <hi>But thou didſt flouriſh a while, and grow up like ſome goodly tree, yet ſudden deſtruction came upon thy children and upon thy eſtate, the robbers have conſumed and ſwallowed all up.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore thou art fooliſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have ſeen the fooliſh taking root, but ſuddenly I curſed his habitation;</hi> I have ſeen thee taking root, and I obſerve thy habitation curſed; Thy outward condition is ſo paralell with theirs, that I know not how to diſtinguiſh thee, from them, in thy inward and ſpirituall condition.</p>
                  <q>I have ſeen the fooliſh taking root.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> urgeth experience. He urged experience in the fourth Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Even as I have ſeen they that plow iniquity and ſow wickedneſſe, reap the ſame,</hi> &amp;c. He urgeth experience here againe, and this ſuperadded experience ſeemes to anſwer an objection which might be made againſt that former experience: For ſome might ſay, many wicked men plow iniquity enough, and ſow wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe abundantly, yet they reap comforts and the contentments of this world: they have what their hearts deſire, a full harveſt of riches, pleaſures and honours.</p>
                  <p>It is true (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz)</hi> I grant it, I have obſerved the like

He flouriſheth, but he withers quickly, he takes root, but he is ſoon puld up by the roots.</p>

A root is to the tree as a foundation is to the houſe, the eſtabliſhment of it; when a tree is well rooted, it takes in the moiſture of the earth freely, then the body or trunk growes big, the branches ſpread forth, the leaves are green, and it abounds with fruit. So that with the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooting, we muſt take in all that concernes the flouriſhing of a tree. Hence, other Scriptures expreſſe the men of the world by trees, not onely ſecretly taking root in the earth, but putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forth and appearing in their viſible beauty and verdure. <hi>(Pſ.</hi> 37. 35.) <hi>David</hi> produceth his experience, <hi>I have ſeen the wicked in great power</hi> (how? <hi>taking root,</hi> yea) <hi>ſpreading himſelfe like a greene bay-tree.</hi> They are deſcribed by their boughs, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and leaves.

The proſperous eſtate of the Church (under the dew and influence of heavenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings) is held forth to us under the notion of a tree taking root. <hi>I will be as the dew to Iſrael, he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt his roots as Lebanon (that is as the trees in Lebanon) his branches ſhall ſpread, and his beauty ſhall be as the Olive tree, and his ſmell as Lebanon.</hi>

                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:40455:100"/> in all his worldly pomp, is ſet forth by a goodly tree. In the 53. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> v. 2. Where the birth of Chriſt is prophecied, it is ſaid, <hi>That, he ſhall grow up before him, as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground.</hi> As a very flouriſhing eſtate, whether in ſpirituals or temporalls, is expreſt by a tree <hi>planted by the water ſide:</hi> So a mean, low eſtate is ſignified by a tree in a dry ground. Our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> in regard of any outward glory, was like a tree in a dry ground, as the words following expound it, <hi>He hath no forme nor comelineſſe, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him.</hi> His kingdome was not like the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of thoſe great Monarchs, ſtrong, and high, and beautifull with any created luſtre. Hence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That wicked men may flouriſh in great outward proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I have ſeen the fooliſh taking root.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the twelfth of his Prophecy (a Scripture touched before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 7. to this purpoſe) being ſomewhat ſcandalized at the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of treacherous dealers, deſcribes them thus, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou haſt planted them, yea they have taken root, they grow, yea they bring forth fruit.</hi> Here are four degrees; firſt they are planted, there is many a tree planted that takes not root, but (ſaith he) <hi>thou haſt planted them, yea, they have taken root:</hi> There are ſome trees which are both planted and have taken root, yet they doe not grow, eſpecially not to any height or greatneſſe, though they live, yet they doe not thrive; Theſe are planted, and they take root and they grow; but there are many trees planted, rooted and growing, which yet are fruitleſſe; theſe have all, they are planted, they take root, they grow and they bring forth fruit; And who are theſe? Surely the worſt of men, as the very next words evidence, <hi>God is neare in their mouthes, but he is far from their reines;</hi> God is neare in the mouth of ſuch, that is, they may ſpeak of him ſometimes, but he is far from their reines, there is nothing of God in their hearts; and ſurely they that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God in their hearts, have nothing of goodneſſe in their hearts, or in their lives.</p>
                  <p>This preſent glory and proſperity of wicked men, lifts up the glory of Gods patience. How is the glory of the patience of God exalted, in letting them have eaſe, who are a burthen unto himſelf? in letting them proſper, who are (as God can be pained) a paine unto himſelfe? in ſuffering them to flouriſh who vex his people, in ſuffering them to laugh, who make his people mourne.</p>

                  <p> Further, He gives them leave to take root and flouriſh (whom he could blaſt and root up every moment) that all may ſee what is in their hearts. If God did not permit them to take root, yea and ſometimes to grow up and flouriſh, we ſhould never ſee what fruit they would bring forth: we ſhould never ſee thoſe grapes of gall, thoſe bitter cluſters; if theſe vines of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and fields of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> were not watered with the dew, and warmed with the Sun of ſome outward proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The proſperity of wicked men, is a great tryall of good men; <hi>The flouriſhing of the ungodly is as ſtrong an exerciſe of their graces, as their own witherings.</hi> Obſerve ſecondly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That wicked men may not onely flouriſh and grow, but they may flouriſh and grow a great while.</hi> I ground it upon this, the text faith, that they take root, <hi>I have ſeen the fooliſh taking roote,</hi> and the word notes a dcep rooting.

Some wicked men ſtand out many ſtormes, like old Oakes, like trees deeply rooted, they ſtand many a blaſt, yea many a blow; ſpectators are ready to ſay, ſuch and ſuch ſtormes will certainly overthrow them, and yet ſtill they ſtand: but though they ſtand ſo long, that all wonder, yet they ſhall fall, that many may rejoyce; <hi>and take up this proverb againſt them</hi> (as of old againſt the King of <hi>Babylon) How hath the oppreſſor ceaſed?

But worldly good things find ſome really good, and make them worſe; others who had but a ſhew of goodneſſe, they are occaſions of making ſtark nought; <hi>Rooting in the earth, never helpt any to grow heaven-wards: Many deeply rooted in the earth, have grown down, and gone down to the depths of Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly obſerve, as a conſequence from the former; <hi>That the enjoyment of outward good things, is no evidence, can be made no argument that a man is good.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The eſtate of ſome wicked men, is out of the prayers of Gods people.</hi> When they goe by their dwellings, they cannot ſay, <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord be upon you, we bleſſe you in the name of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 129. 8. It is a great mercy to ſtand under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of prayer, and for a man to have his eſtate, land, dwellings watered with ſhowers of bleſſings and hearty good wiſhes from the mouths of Saints. Their bleſſings or their curſings, are next to the bleſſings and curſings of Chriſt, nay, they are his; It is an argument that Chriſt hath bleſſed or curſed a man, when the ſpirits of his people generally are carried to either. It is one of the ſaddeſt preſages in the world, for a man to be caſt out of the prayers of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40455:102"/> Saints, or to be caſt by their prayers; that is, when their prayers are againſt him, and he preſented naked to the diſpleaſure of Chriſt: It ſhewes that the ſin of a man is a ſin unto death, when the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ceaſe praying for him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A wicked man in proſperity is under the curſe of God.</hi> He is often under the curſe of man, but ever under the curſe of God. <hi>Eſau have I hated</hi> (ſaith God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13.) yet even at that time <hi>the fatneſſe of the earth was his dwelling, and of the dew of Heaven from above,</hi> Gen. 27. 39. <hi>While the meate was in the mouthes of the murmuring Iſraelites, the wrath of God was upon them.</hi> They did at once eate their luſt and their death, wrath was mingled with their meate; and <hi>while he gave them their requeſt, he ſent leaneneſſe into their ſoules, (Pſal.</hi> 106. 15.) This is the moſt dreadfull curſe of all, <hi>To have a fate eſtate, a well fed body, with a leane ſtarven ſoule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve a vaſt difference between godly and wicked men, between the fooliſh and the wiſe. When a godly man wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his outward eſtate, and is pluckt up by the rootes, yet God loves him; when a godly man is poore, God loves him, when he is ſick, God loves him, when he is in priſon, God loves him, when he is in diſgrace, God loves him, and when the world hates him moſt, then God uſually ſhewes, that he loves him moſt; <hi>The world cannot caſt a godly man into any condition, but he meets with the love of God in it;</hi> his eſtate may vary and vary, change and change a thouſand times, but the love of God towards him is unchangeable. On the other ſide, we ſee in the text, when a wicked man takes roote, and the branches of his outward eſtate beare fruit abundantly, God curſeth him; when he is at eaſe, God is angry with him. That place is very obſerveable <hi>(Zech.</hi> 1. 15.) <hi>I am very ſore diſpleaſed with the Heathen, that are at eaſe;</hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then were at eaſe, yet God was extreamely diſpleaſed with them.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40455:103"/> When a wicked man is in health God curſeth him, when he is rich God curſeth him, when all men honour admire and flatter him, God abhorreth, hates and deteſts him; he can be in no condition, but he is ſure to meet with the curſe of God. As a fooliſh man, a wicked m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, gives God many things, but he never gives God his love, or his affection; A wicked man may give God prayers, but he doth not give him his love; he may give him praiſes, but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gives him any love; he may give God his purſe, but he gives not his love or his heart; whether ſuch a foole praiſeth God, or prayeth to God, or giveth unto God, he hateth God. So likewiſe, whatſoever God gives to a wicked man he hates him, whatſoever he beſtowes on him he curſeth him: This ſhould awake men roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the earth, to conſider whether they are under the influences of Gods eternall love, as well as under the influence of temporall bleſſings: This is the ground of <hi>Davids</hi> concluſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 16. <hi>A little that the righteous hath, is better than the ricehes of many wicked:</hi> the reaſon is this, becauſe many ungodly ones, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a full ſea of riches, have not ſo much as one drop of the love of God, nor one beame or ray of the light of his countenance ſhining upon them: but a godly man, if he have but a ſmall eſtate, he hath much love mixed with it, if he have but a little purſe, he hath a large portion of the favour of God in it, and this makes it ſo out-worth and out-value a wicked mans eſtate, this puts the price and ſtamps an excellency upon his little. The love of God doth ſo farre exceed the fatneſs of the earth, in the eſteeme of Saints, that they in rating their eſtates, reckon not upon earthly things at all, they ſee nothing to value themſelves by, but their intereſts in the love of God. As when God gives his people their portion, he lookes upon outward things, as meere additionalls, or as an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus given in by way of vantage. <hi>All other things ſhall be added (Mat.</hi> 6. 33.) when a man caſts in a handfull of wheate after the buſhell is full, or gives a fingers bredth after the due meaſure of the cloath; So it is in the caſe of all temporals beſtowed upon the Saints: Then fourthly note;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Outward good things, are no argument of the favour of God.</hi>

                  <p>As we ſhewed before, that, they are no evidences of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a perſon, ſo neither are they any evidences of the grace and favour of God unto a perſon. <hi>A man cannot find an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Gods love in his purſe, in his land, in his honour, in his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit:</hi> Yea a man may flouriſh in better things then theſe I ſpeake of,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40455:103"/> and yet have no evidences of Gods love to him; A man may flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in knowledge, be deeply rooted in learning, may have extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary branches of parts, and wonderfull fruits of gifts, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this while, his habitation and his perſon too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a curſe. And therefore, be ſure that you looke for your evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the love of God in the right boxe, doe not looke for evidences of the love of God in your cheſts, or in your purſes, but looke into your hearts, and ſee what Chriſt hath done there, looke into your lives, and ſee what light ſhines there from the Spirit of Chriſt; Looke whether grace flowes from the Spirit of Chriſt, and is rooted in your ſpirits. If grace be rooted in thee there, if it ſpring up and bring forth fruit in the life, this is an evidence indeed. They that are thus rooted, God never curſeth, Grace and holineſs were never under any curſe.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve one thing further, As theſe words hold forth the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or opinion of a godly man, concerning the wicked in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. <hi>I have ſeen the fooliſh taking root, and preſently I curſed his habitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A godly man ſees the wicked of the world to be miſerable in their beſt and moſt flouriſhing condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When thouſands ſtand about the great ones of the earth, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, applauding, making <hi>little gods</hi> of them, envying their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and thinking none happy but they, or ſuch as they are; then a godly man pitties them, mournes over them, ſees them, and all ſuch as they are, miſerable; He lookes through all their outward glory and beauty, riches and honours, and ſees them curſt through all, hated of God through all; He ſees nakedneſſe through their cloathing, emptineſs and want through all their plenty and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: neither is this unhappineſſe confined to their own perſons, but derived to all, to whom they derive life, or ſtand related. So it followes;</p>

                  <p>But we may rather take it, as the matter, then as the forme of a curſe. <hi>I curſed his habitation,</hi> and the curſe brake forth upon his children, and upon his eſtate, upon the branches, and the fruit of that goodly tree: much like that in the viſion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>I ſaw in the viſions of my head upon my bed, and behold a watcher, and a holy One, came downe from Heaven, He cryed aloud and ſaid thus; Hew downe the tree, and cut off his branches, ſhake off his leaves, and ſcatter his fruit, &amp;c.</hi> This Allegory may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the plaine words of <hi>Eliphaz, I curſed his habitation, his children are far from ſafety.</hi> The Maſter of the Family is the tree, His children are either fruit or branches, His leaves are riches and honour, the beauty and pleaſantneſſe of his habitation.</p>
                  <p>Some things in the letter of the text are to be opened, but I ſhall firſt obſerve one thing in the generall, from the connection of this fourth verſe with the third, <hi>I ſuddenly curſed his habitation</hi> (verſe 3.)

                     <hi>Creatures cannot ſtand before the curſe of God.</hi> How ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever they are rooted, the blaſt of the breath of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, will either blow them downe, or wither them ſtanding. The curſe comes powerfully, ſuddenly and ſecretly, it is often an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſtroake. When we ſee neither axe nor ſpade at the roote, nor ſtrome at rhe top, yet downe it comes, or ſtands without leafe or fruit. When Chriſt in the Goſpell curſt the fruitleſſe figg-tree, his Diſciples paſſing by that way, wondred ſaying, <hi>how quickly is</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:40455:104"/> 
                     <hi>this figg-tree whithered?</hi> it was but onely a word from Chriſt, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beare fruit more,</hi> and the fig-tree which had no fruit, loſt its life. Some are ſuch tall Cedars, ſuch mighty Oakes, that men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there is no ſtirring of them, no Axe can fell them, or blaſt looſen them; yet a word from the Lord will turne them up ſide downe: or if he doe but ſay to them, <hi>never fruit grow</hi> upon your actions or out of your counſels, preſently they wither. <hi>The curſe cauſleſſe ſhall not come,</hi> but when there is a cauſe, and God ſpeaks the word, the curſe will come; Neither power nor policies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther threatnings or entreaties can hinder or block it up.

                  <q>They are far from ſafety.</q>
                  <p>To be far from ſafety, is a phraſe importing extreame danger; As when a man is ſaid to be far from light, he is in extreame dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and when a man is ſaid to be far from health, he is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſickneſſe; and when a man is ſaid to be far from riches, he is in extreame poverty: So here, <hi>His children are far from ſafety,</hi> that is, they are in extreame danger and perill, they walk (as it were) in the regions of trouble, in the valley of the ſhadow of death continually. That phraſe is uſed alſo, reſpecting the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eſtate of unbeleevers, <hi>They are far off from God, far off from the Covenant,</hi> Iſa. 57. 19. Epheſ. 12. 13. that is, they have no benefit by the Covenant, no intereſt in, no favour at all or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Lord. To be far off from mercy is to be neare wrath, and to be <hi>far from ſafety</hi> is to dwell upon the borders of danger.</p>
                  <q>And they are cruſhed in the gate.</q>
                  <p>In the forth Chapter <hi>Eliphaz</hi> deſcribes man, as <hi>cruſhed before</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:40455:105"/> 
                     <hi>the moth,</hi> to ſhew how ſuddenly, how eaſily man is deſtroyed. This mans children are cruſhed in the gate, as a man would cruſh a flie or a moth between his fingers.</p>
                  <q>They are cruſhed in the gate.</q>
                  <p>That notes two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the publikeneſſe of their deſtruction, they ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſight of all men; for the gate was a publike place <hi>(Pro-</hi> 31. 31.) <hi>her workes praiſe her in the gates,</hi> that is, ſhe is publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne by her good works. To doe a thing in the gate is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the doing of a thing ſecretly. To ſuffer in the gate is to ſuffer publikely.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>to be cruſhed in the gate,</hi> is to be cruſhed or caſt in judgement; for <hi>The gate</hi> was the place of old, where juſtice was <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Inportis judicia exercebantur.</hi> Merc.</note> adminiſtred and judgement given; and for a man to be cruſhed in the gate, is as much as for a man to be overthrowne in his ſure, when he hath any controverſie or tryall before a Judge, whether for his eſtate or for his life. So this phraſe, <hi>They are cruſhed in the gate,</hi> implies that all buſineſſes ſhall goe againſt them, if they have any controverſie in law, or if they be charged with any crime they ſhall certainly be condemned.</p>
                  <p>I need not ſtay to prove that judgement was given in the gate; onely take a few texts. Firſt, in this booke (Chap. 29. 7.). <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes his owne proſperity thus, <hi>When I went out to the gate,</hi> that is, to ſit in judgement; And <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 21. the word is uſed in the like ſenſe; So <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 34. 20. <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 11. Thoſe words of the curſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 7. <hi>when he is judged, let him be condemned,</hi> are the full Expoſition of this, <hi>They are cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the gate.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And the reaſon given by one of the Ancients, why juſtice was uſually adminiſtred in the gate, is the accommodation and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience both of ſtrangers and Citizens: For ſtrangers, who lived far off in the country, that they might have juſtice, before they entred into the city, whoſe pompe and throngs of people might poſſibly occaſion either ſome terrour or diverſion in the minds of poore country-men. And then likewiſe, that the Inhabitants of the City, might not be either charged or tired with long journies into the country; To which we may adde, that judgement was therefore adminiſtred in the gate, becauſe gates are places through which all paſſe in and out, and therefore the declaring of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40455:106"/> there, was the making of it more publike, that all might take notice of what paſſed, in ſuch and ſuch caſes, as the ſentence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Judges.</p>
                  <q>Neither is there any to deliver them.</q>

                     <hi>armes or weapons.</hi> The Hebrew word which we tranſlate <hi>thornes,</hi> gives occaſion of theſe various readings, which ſome derive from <hi>Tſinnah,</hi> which ſignifies a ſhield, and ſo by a trope, it notes any kind of armes or weapons.</p>
                  <p>If we take the word in the firſt ſenſe, for <hi>thornes,</hi> a three-fold interpretation may be given of this clauſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt as Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> reades it, <hi>which he had gotten thorough</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:40455:109"/> 
                     <hi>the thornes.</hi> This refers to the manner how a worldling obtaines his eſtate; he hath a great harveſt, and how came he by it? <hi>he got it thorough the thornes;</hi> that is, he got it thorough vexing, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares, for ſo <hi>(Mat.</hi> 13.) in the Parable of the ſower, when Chriſt expounds the meaning of the <hi>thorny ground,</hi> he ſhewes, that the <hi>thornes are cares,</hi> the cares wherewith men are vexed in getting riches, or compaſſing the things of the world. Hence a man is ſaid to get riches thorough the thornes, when he gets them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough overmuch care and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the word ſignifies <hi>thornes:</hi> ſome conceive, that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> cloſely deſcribes the perſons who ſhould take away his eſtate, as he did in the former branch; there he ſaid, <hi>the hungry eate up his harveſt;</hi> now he deſcribeth another ſort of men that ſhall eate it up, namely, <hi>Men of thornes, or Men comming out of the thornes;</hi> This rendring, is not eaſily made out of the Originall, though, it hath learned a bettors, and therefore I am not confident of it; yet it may yeeld ſome advantage to our meditation upon the words. The meaning is this: Meane or contemptible men ſhall <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Homo ex ſpinis exiens, ſc. abie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptus eum rapiet. Homo ignobilis qui de ſpinis naſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Merc.</note> take it away: As in our language, when we would expreſſe a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar perſon, a man of low birth, we ſay, <hi>he was borne under a buſh; or under a hedge,</hi> that is, he is a man of a low pedigree, none of the <hi>Gentry;</hi> and ſo it is, as if he ſhould ſay, this great, rich, mighty man, who hath ſo much honour and riches about him, and thinks himſelfe ſafe, ſhall ſee a man comming out of the thornes, ſome obſcure perſon, and take all that he hath from him. This expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may yeeld us a profitable obſervation, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When God reckons with the greateſt of wicked men, hee can humble and pull them downe by the meaneſt and pooreſt of men.</hi> A very ſhrub, a man that comes out of the thornes may pull downe the talleſt Cedar; It encreaſes affliction, to be overcome by a weake, deſpiſed, inconſiderable enemy. It troubled <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> more to be ſlaine by a woman, than to be ſlaine; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (upon the matter) he would have the paine to be twice kil'd, rather than the diſgrace to be kil'd by a woman; for having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his deaths-wound by her hand, yet, <hi>he calls haſtily to the young man his Armour-bearer, and ſaid unto him; draw out thy ſword now, and ſlay me, that men ſay not of me, a woman ſlew him, Judg.</hi> 10. 54. The Lord threatens it, both as a juſt retaliation for the ſin, and an aggravation of the puniſhment of his people, <hi>I will move them to jealouſie with thoſe that are not a people, I will</hi>

                     <hi>provoke them to anger with a fooliſh Nation,</hi> Deut. 32. 21. The Gentiles, as <hi>Paul</hi> expounds this place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 19. and <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 10.) whom the Jewes ſleighted as a fooliſh people, as no people, came in and eate up the harveſt of the Goſpell, and were inveſted with greater priviledges than they. This made the Jewes mad with anger, as you may reade in that famous record of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. They could not beare it, that, Thoſe <hi>men of the thornes, ſhould partake of the fatneſſe of the Olive.</hi> As <hi>Jotham</hi> ſpake in his Parable, <hi>(Judg.</hi> 9 15.) when the queſtion was, which of the trees ſhould be King, the olive or the vine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at laſt it fell to <hi>the brambles lot, or to the thorne.</hi> That parable gives ſome light to this expoſition: For thoſe ſeverall ſorts of trees ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the ſeverall ſorts of men, and the bramble ſhadowed out the meaneſt ſort of men; a man of thornes, or a man comming out of the thornes. And he adds (which further anſwers this ſenſe) <hi>Let fire come out of the bramble, and devoure the Cedars of Laba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;</hi> which in plaine Engliſh is, let there come power from a powerleſſe man, who is but as a bryer, or as a thorne, and conſume the greateſt and the mightieſt.</p>
                  <p>And it may ſupport us (while we ſee ſo many great Cedars and ſtrong Okes, with whom we have to doe) that God can ſend a man out of the thornes to ſubdue their pride; and can cauſe a bramble to conſume Cedars, when himſelfe pleaſeth, The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> puts the queſtion, <hi>By whom ſhall Jacob riſe, for he is ſmall?</hi> The onely anſwer is, <hi>Jacob</hi> hath a great God, a God that can doe great things: If we ſhould queſtion, <hi>by whom ſhall the wicked fall, for they are very great?</hi> I anſwer, haply, <hi>they ſhall fall by him, that is very ſmall,</hi> A man out of the buſhes, a man of thornes, ſome poore ſhrub, armed with the power of God, ſhall ſhake and overthrow them in the height of all their wickedneſſe and worldly glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Take it according to our reading: <hi>He ſhall fetch it out of the thornes.</hi> Which ſome interpret, to be thornes growing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in or among the corne; according to that generall curſe upon the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Thornes and thiſtles ſhall it bring forth to thee.</hi> But rather (if not alone) theſe are thornes platted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether induſtriouſly, and wrought into a hedge, to ſave corne fields or corne-ſtackes from ſpoile. So the meaning is, that when the hungry man comes with a commiſſion from God, to eate the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of the fooliſh, he will have his eſtate whatever it coſts him,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40455:110"/> or what danger ſoever he incurres for it. For, as a man is ſaid to fetch a thing out of the fire, or out of the Lions mouth, when he <note place="margin">
                        <hi>E ſpinis, hoc eſt, è magno periculo: ſicut nos dicimus ex ore Leonum.</hi> Druſ.</note> gets it with much perill and hazzard; ſo, what a man gets with much difficulty and labour, he is ſaid to get it out of the thornes. And the reaſon is this, becauſe, men were wont, when they had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in their harveſt (take it eſpecially about that, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion about any thing elſe) they were then wont (I ſay) to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quamvis inter ſpinas abdita ſit &amp; forſan ut tutior ſit.</hi> Merc.</note> it with a thorn-hedge, or to lay buſhes about their ſtacks, to keep off cattle or any other annoyances. We read among the Lawes given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſomewhat anſwerable to this practice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 6. <hi>If fire breake out and catch in thornes, ſo that the ſtacks of corne, or ſtanding corne, or the field be conſumed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he that kindled the fire, ſhall make reſtitution.</hi> This Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates it for an ancient cuſtome, to make fences of thornes about corne brought home or ſtackt up; And that fields while the corne was ſtanding, were hedged about with thornes. To either of which, the alluſion may be made by <hi>Eliphaz:</hi> So that, to fetch his harveſt out of the thorns, is to fetch it through the fences made to ſecure his harveſt, to fetch it, though it coſt (as we ſpeak prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bially) <hi>a ſcratcht face, or ſcratcht fingers.</hi> We ſay, <hi>hunger breaks through ſtones walls,</hi> certainly then theſe hungry ones, will break through a thorne hedge.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord would keep his Church from wandring in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paths, he reſolves thus, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>I will hedge up her way with thornes:</hi> there are pleaſures that ſhe would goe fetch, but as men fence their ground and paſtures with thornes, ſo will I doe with her, I will hedge up her way with thornes, <hi>ſhe ſhall pay dear, ſhe ſhall ſmart for her pleaſures, ere ſhe come at them.</hi> And therefore, as it ſhewes the extreame intenſiveneſſe and reſolvedneſſe of a man to ſin; when a man will ſin, though God hath hedged up his way with thorns, that is, when a man will break thorough many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and run hazzards to ſatisfie his luſts; ſo here in this place, the hungry mans taking it out of the thornes, notes a reſolvedneſſe and eagerneſſe of ſpirit, to have the eſtate of this rich man, let him ſecure it by all the power and policies he can.</p>
                  <p>From this Expoſition, we may obſerve firſt, the practice of worldly wiſe men; when they have gotten riches, they doe not leave them looſe and open to ſurpriſall, they keep them among the thornes; they will ſecure their eſtates as much as they can. As they get riches with thorns, ſo they will keep riches with thorns,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40455:111"/> that is, they will beſtow care to keep, as well as to get: A godly man takes great care to get more of Chriſt, more riches of grace, he improves all means, and makes this his buſineſſe night and day; theſe ſpirituall cares are <hi>his thornes:</hi> and when he finds his ſtock of holy things increaſing, his next care is to preſerve his ſtock, to maintaine communion with Chriſt, and to keep up his graces to their height; <hi>The care of a godly man, is as much to preſerve grace and comforts from the power of that hungry one the Devill, as it was to fetch them in.</hi> And Satan is ſo hungry after our ſpirituall harveſt, that, he would fetch it out of the thorns and fences of all our prayers and holy cares, were it not that Chriſt himſelfe keeps it for us, His care over his peoples ſpirituall welfare is ſuch a <hi>thorn hedge,</hi> as the Devill can never break thorough; We are kept by the power of God as with a garriſon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>Such alſo, is the wiſdome of that generation, about worldly things: they fence in, and fortifie their riches, ſo that if any man will have them, he muſt have them through the thornes, or come upon the pikes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though he lay up his eſtate within the thorns, yet, the hungry man will fetch it out. Note then,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That all the care of worldly men, all the thorne-hedges they make about their eſtates, ſhall never ſecure them from ſpoyle and ruine.</hi> The hungry will preſſe and venture through the thorns to take them.</p>
                  <p>Further, As the word ſignifies <hi>a Buckler</hi> (or any kind of arms, whether offenſive or defenſive) as the text is by ſome tranſlated, <hi>He ſhall fetch it out of their Armes, or from among their weapons.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The armed man ſhall take him away,</hi> that is, he ſhall carry him away priſoner, and ſpoyl him of his harveſt: Which, though it doth not comply with the letter of the Original, yet it implies the ſence of it.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is the ſame in ſubſtance with the former, and we may ſay here as <hi>Joſeph</hi> about the dreams of <hi>Pharoah, The dreames are the ſame, and they are doubled, onely to note the certainty of the thing:</hi> The matter here is the ſame, onely the words are doubled (as the Holy Ghoſt often doth) to note the certainty of this thing, that the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh mans eſtate ſhall be conſumed.</p>
                  <p>Yet, there is ſomewhat very conſiderable in the phraſe here u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and therefore I ſhall open it a little; <hi>The robber ſwalloweth up his ſubſtance.</hi>

                  <p>We render it, <hi>The robber ſwalloweth up their ſubſtance.</hi> The reaſon of this difference is from the Originall word, which may have a double derivation: Firſt from a root, ſignifying to thirſt or to be thirſty: Secondly from a root which ſignifies the haire of the head, or the locks, or extraordinary ruffian-like long haire and locks. And the reaſon, why we tranſlate <hi>Robber,</hi> is given from both: From the firſt, becauſe robbers and ſpoylers are commonly Toſſe pots and drunkards, men that love their liquor, a thirſty ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in that ſence; and they alwayes thirſt for a prey, they thirſt for the eſtates or lives of others: From the latter, becauſe robbers, plunderers and ſpoilers, uſually wore very long haire, either to diſguiſe or make themſelves the more terrible; So that a robber may be denominated, both from his unnaturally naturall
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40455:112"/> thirſt after the pot, and from his uncivilly civill thirſt after a purſe, or from his long, ſhaggy, buſhy haire: To this latter ſence, one of <note place="margin">

                  <p>THus far <hi>Eliphaz</hi> hath ſpent his diſcourſe, in reproofe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; And you have had out of the 4 Chapter, and the precedant part of this, foure heads of reaſon, or arguments, by which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> labours to reprove <hi>Job,</hi> for, and convince him of, cloſe ſin, or of groſſe hypocriſie. Now <hi>Eliphaz</hi> turns himſelf to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſtile, and falls to counſell and exhortation, directing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing <hi>Job</hi> what becomes him, what he ought to doe, in his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: His exhortation conſiſts of two diſtinct branches.</p>
                  <p>The former whereof begins at this ſixth, and is continued to the ſeventeenth verſe of the Chapter. The ſumme of this exhortation is, <hi>That, for as much as he had found him ſo diſtempered in his ſpeech and carriage, he now earneſtly beſeeches and intreats him, that he would ſeek unto God, beg favour, and believingly commit himſelfe and his cauſe unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond branch of exhortation begins at the 17 verſe, and is continued to the end of the Chapter. The Scope whereof is, <hi>That</hi> Job <hi>would humbly and patiently ſubmit himſelfe unto, and under, the correcting hand of God, quietly waiting the time of his deliverance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The matter of the former exhortation lies in the words of the 8 verſe, <hi>I would ſeek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſtrengthneth this exhortation by two arguments, whereof</p>
                  <p>The firſt is taken from the cauſe of his afflictions, and that either the efficient, or the meritorious cauſe of his afflictions, both which we find in the 6 and 7 verſes.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond argument by which he ſtrengthneth his firſt exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is contained in the 9, 10, 11, and 12 verſes following,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40455:113"/> and it is grounded upon the power, wiſdome and goodneſs of God: As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Who would not ſeek unto God, who is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, able to deliver? Who would not ſeek unto a God, and commit his cauſe unto him, who is gracious, and pittifull, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ready to deliver? Who would not ſeeke unto a God, and commit his cauſe unto him, who is of infinite wiſdome to find out wayes and means for the contriving of deliverance, though mans condition (to the eye of ſence or humane reaſon) ſeem altogether deſperate and remedileſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe three verſes containe the firſt exhortation, together with the firſt argument; And we may forme it thus, both reſpecting the efficient, and the meritorious cauſe of his afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, reſpecting the efficient cauſe, the argument ſeemes to lie thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is to be ſought unto in our afflictions, who is the principall effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe or ſender of our afflictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But, God is the principall efficient cauſe and ſender of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore, he is to be ſought unto, and, to him our cauſe is to be committed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major or firſt Propoſition,</hi> is not expreſly in this text, but it is plainly ſuppoſed, and logically to be underſtood. <hi>The Minor or the Aſſumption,</hi> lies in the 6 and 7 verſes, where he proves that God is the efficient cauſe or ſender of afflictions; And his proof is grounded upon a deniall, or a removall of all other efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. As, if he ſhould ſay, there muſt be ſome efficient cauſe of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but no efficient cauſe can be aſſigned or named, except God: therefore God is the efficient cauſe, the ſender and orderer of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. That, no other efficient cauſe can be aſſigned, he proveth plainly in the ſixth verſe, thus; <hi>Affliction cometh not forth of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground, yet, man is borne to trouble</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, our eyes teach us, we ſee plainly man is full of trouble; man is no ſooner borne, but he is afflicted; theſe afflictions muſt have ſome efficient cauſe, ſome hand or other doth frame, forme, and faſhion them, they come not alone; and if they come not alone, then, we muſt find out this cauſe either in earth or in heaven: we muſt find it, either in the Creatour or among the creatures, but from the earth, or from creatures, they come not. <hi>Affliction cometh not forth of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground,</hi> that is, it riſes not by or from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40455:114"/> the creatures in themſelves, and alone conſidered; and if ſo, it muſt needs come from heaven, from the hand of God, who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth above, and diſpoſeth all things according to the pleaſure of his own will. It is ſuch a kind of ſpeech, as often falls from us, when a thing is loſt; we ſay, ſome body muſt have it; <hi>Sure it is not gone into the gound, You or You</hi> muſt have it, for there were none elſe in the place. So, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſeems here to argue about the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he ſaw upon <hi>Job:</hi> here are heavy afflictions upon thee, theſe afflictions muſt come ſome way upon thee, <hi>They come not out forth of the duſt, neither doe they ſpring out of the ground, they come not up alone;</hi> Either then they muſt come from God or man; and from man, they come not; they ſpring not out of the earth: therefore he leaves it as a clear inference, that God is the efficient cauſe or ſender of affliction.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if we conſider this argument, as it ſtrengthneth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation from the <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of his afflictions. It may be formed thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the ſin of man be from himſelfe, and the ſufferings of man be for his ſin, then in his ſufferings for ſin, he ought to ſeek unto God, and to commit his cauſe unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But, the ſin of man is from himſelfe, and the ſufferings of man are for his ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore, he ought in ſuch a condition to ſeeke unto God, and commit his cauſe unto him;</hi> For, remedy is no where elſe to be had. This ſecond argument is grounded rather upon the expoſition, then the letter of the text, as ſhall be further cleared in purſuance of the words.</p>
                  <p>Thus, you ſee, how the <hi>Minor</hi> or ſecond Propoſition is confirmed, both, as it reſpects the efficient cauſe, and the meritorious cauſe of mans affliction. The concluſion lies in the 8 verſe, which <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Concluſi enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciata in perſona</hi> Eliphazi. <hi>quod modeſtum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortationis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus magnam vim habet, &amp; eſt uſitatiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> Merl.</note> pronounces in his own perſon, <hi>I would ſeeke unto God,</hi> therefore ſeek thou unto God, he ſpeakes it in his own perſon, thereby more freely to inſinuate his counſell, and make way for his exhortation.

                  <p>Firſt (which is its moſt proper ſence) it is taken cauſally, and then the text is read, <hi>For, affliction commeth not forth of the duſt.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Broughton, for ſorrow iſſueth not from the duſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>

                  </p>

                     </hi> And it is neceſſary to give it this latitude; the word equally bearing both ſenſes. As it is read, <hi>Iniquity comes not,</hi> &amp;c. We learn,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>We bring forth the fruit at our tongues or fingers ends, and the root is in our hearts.

The naturall births of mans heart have all one common face and feature; They are all of one common conſtitution. <hi>Evill all.</hi> Secondly, We may obſerve, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The meritorious cauſe of mans ſuffering is from his ſinne.</hi>

                     <hi>Iniquity ſpringeth not from the ground, neither doth trouble come out of the duſt.</hi> As iniquity ſprings from our ſelves, ſo we may reſolve it, that miſery ſprings from our ſinne. It is a truth, (as hath been touched upon the ſecond Chapter) that, God, in many afflictions laid upon his dear children and ſervants, reſpects not their ſin as the cauſe procuring and drawing on theſe afflictions. And very many are afflicted by the world, not for ſinnes ſake, but for righteouſneſs ſake. As Chriſt, ſo ſome Chriſtians may ſay in their ſpheare, <hi>We have done many good works, for which of them doe ye ſtone us?</hi> Yet this is as cleare a truth, that, the ſinne of any man is in it ſelfe a ſufficient meritorious cauſe of any, yea, of all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A creature cannot beare a greater puniſhment, then the leaſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40455:116"/> of his ſinnes deſerves. Man weaves a ſpiders webb of ſinne out of his owne bowels, and then he is intangled in the ſame webb; the troubles which inſnare, and wrappe about him, are twiſted with his own fingers. Thirdly, obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Naturally every man ſeekes the reaſon of his ſorrows and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When man is afflicted, he is not willing to owne himſelf, as the cauſe of his afflictions, or acknowledge that they ſpring from his ſinne; and, that may be the reaſon, why <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks thus to <hi>Job,</hi> as if he had ſaid, thy thoughts are wandring abroad, thou little thinkſt that thy afflictions were bred in thy owne boſome: Thou art faſtning the cauſe of then upon this, and t'other thing; Thou art complaining of the day wherein thou waſt borne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt rather complain of the ſin wherein thou waſt born; Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Iſa's</hi> time were in great diſtreſſe, and could get no deliverance. The ports and paſſages of mercy were all obſtructed. Now, whether went their thoughts? And what did they looke upon, as the reaſon of thoſe abiding lingring evils? we may reade their thoughts in the refutation of them; we may ſee what the diſeaſe of their hearts was, by the medicine which the Prophet applies unto them: he labours to purge them from that conceit, as if either want of power, or want of love in the Lord were the ſtop of their deliverance. <hi>The Lords hand is not ſhortned that he cannot ſave, neither his eare heavy, that he cannot heare,</hi> Iſa. 59. 1, 2. as if he had ſaid, I know what your apprehenſions are in theſe affliction, you thinke the reaſon is in God, that either he cannot, or he will not ſave you: You think the hand of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſhrunke up, or the eare of his mercy ſhut up, but, you reflect not upon your ſelves, nor conſider, that <hi>Your iniquities have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated between you and your God;</hi> Your ſinne does you hurt, and you touch not that with a little finger, but lay the weight of your charge upon God himſelfe. So <hi>(Hoſ.</hi> 13. 9.) <hi>Thy deſtruction is from thy ſelf, in me is thy help.</hi> God is forced to tel them ſo, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was from themſelves, they would not believe it: they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it was from the cruelty or malice of the creature, from the wrath and rage of enemies, from ſome overſight or neglect of their friends; therefore the Lord ſpeaks out in expreſſe termes, <hi>Thy deſtruction is from thy ſelf.</hi> It ſprings not forth of the duſt, neither is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40455:116"/> thy deſtruction from me; <hi>In me is thy help;</hi> in both the heart of man failes equally, we are ready to ſay, that the good we have comes from our ſelves, that our help and comforts are from our own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdom, and ſo offer ſacrifice to our own nets, <hi>as if by them our portion were fat:</hi> but for evil and deſtruction we aſſigne it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over, ſomtime to men, and ſo are angry; ſometime to God, and ſo blaſpheme. <hi>We naturally decline what reflects ſhame upon our ſelves, or ſpeaks us guilty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From our tranſlation, <hi>Although affliction,</hi> &amp;c- Obſerve</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Every affliction hath a cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Proverbe carries that ſenſe, in every common underſtanding. Our afflictions have a cauſe, a certaine cauſe, they come not by hap hazzard, or by accident. Many things are caſuall, but nothing is without a cauſe. Many things are not fore ſeene by man, but all things are fore-ordained by God. The Prophet <hi>Amos (Ch.</hi> 3. 6.) ſets forth this by an elegant ſimilitude, <hi>Can a bird fall in a ſnare upon the earth, where no ginne is for him?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, is a bird taken in a ſnare by chance, where none have prepared, ſet or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly laid a ſnare or a ginne to take him? The bird ſaw not the ſnare, but the ſnare was ſet for the <hi>Bird.</hi> Snaresfall not on the ground at adventure, they grow not out of the earth of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but the fowler, by his art and induſtry, invents and frames them a purpoſe to catch the bird: Thus, the calamity and troubles in which men are caught and lime-twig'd, inſnared and ſhackled in the world, come not out of the ground, <hi>They are not acts of chance, but of providence:</hi> The wiſe and holy God ſets ſuch ſnares, to take and hold fooliſh, unruly men, like ſilly birds, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping after the baits of worldy pleaſures. Which meaning is cleare from the ſcope and tendency of the whole Chapter; but the next queſtion reſolves it in the letter, <hi>Is there any evill in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Thoſe words are both the concluſion and explication of the former ſimilitude. Secondly, obſerve</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Affliction is not from the power of any creature.</hi> As it comes not by chance or without a cauſe, ſo not by the power of creatures, they are not the cauſe; <hi>duſt and the ground,</hi> are oppoſed to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or to a divine power: Creatures (in this ſenſe) can neither doe good, nor doe evill. <hi>The world would be as full of trouble, as it is of ſin, if ſinfull men could make trouble:</hi> It is not in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a creature, no not of all the creatures in Heaven or earth, to forme or to make out one affliction, without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40455:117"/> and allowance of God himſelfe. <hi>Men alone, can neither make staves of comfort, nor rods of affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence thirdly, A conſectary from both may be, That <hi>Afflictions are from the Lord as from the efficient cauſe, the directer and orderer of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe evils are from a creating, not from a created ſtrength. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>forme the light and create darkneſſe,</hi> Iſa. 45. 7. Naturall darkneſſe hath only a deficient cauſe, but poenall darkneſſe hath an efficient cauſe. <hi>Darkneſſe is created.</hi> As in the firſt creation God ſaid, <hi>let there be light,</hi> ſo in providence (which is a continued creation) he ſaith, <hi>let there be darkneſſe.</hi> If afflictions come not forth of the earth, then they come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That wicked King preacht very good doctrine, when he ſaid of an extreame devouring famine, <hi>This evill is from the Lord,</hi> though he failed utterly in the uſe or application, while he mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured out <hi>why ſhould we waite on the Lord any longer?</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 33. For, the reaſon holds ſtrong to the contrary, This evill is from the Lord, we will waite upon the Lord for ever.</p>
                  <q>Verſe 7. <hi>Yet, man is borne unto trouble, as the ſparks flye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet man,</hi> or <hi>but man</hi> is borne to trouble: Some reade, <hi>Man is borne to ſin,</hi> that is, he is borne with a nature ready and prone to ſin, becauſe <hi>he is borne in ſin, Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. And ſo by conſequent he is borne to trouble, which is cauſed by and is the fruit of ſin. Theſe two, ſin and trouble, are ſo neere in blood and kindred, that ſtill one word includes them both; The former word which ſignifies ſin, properly is tranſlated affliction, and this word which ſignifies affliction, properly may be tranſlated ſin. When it is ſaid, That <hi>Man is borne to trouble or ſin;</hi> It notes two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A right to them, a right to ſinne, and a right to ſorrow. That which a man is borne to, is duely his, it is his inheritance, or his birth-right; that is the common underſtanding of the phraſe: As ſome men are borne to a great eſtate, to lands and honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo all men are borne to trouble and ſin; They are ours by a line all right, derived from our next, yea firſt parents, ſo they deſcend to us as land deſcends.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It implies a readineſſe, or a fitneſſe to commit ſin, or to falls into trouble: When a man is ſaid to be borne to a thing, it note him exceeding apt and forward to take it: He needs little teaching
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40455:117"/> and inſtructing, little cultivating or manuring. As when a man makes verſes readily, we ſay he was borne to Poetry; or when a man gets wealth eaſily, we ſay, he was borne to be rich. So in the preſent caſe; A mans underſtanding, will and affections, need no manaring or dreſſing to bring forth ſinne, or the fruit of it, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. He is borne to ſin.</p>
                  <p>The latter clauſe of the verſe cleares the ſenſe fully, <hi>Manis borne unto trouble, or unto ſinne, as the ſparks fly upward;</hi> The meaning is, as the ſparks have a principle in themſelves, by which they aſcend, they need no directing; when a ſparke comes out from the fire, no man bids it flye upward, or ſhewes it the way, it will flye upward alone, it knowes no other way, but upward; ſo, it is a naturall courſe for man, as ſoone as he is borne, to ſin and work his own ſorrow. This he can doe, the firſt thing he doth, and before he can doe any thing, well, he can doe this, but, too well; <hi>He needs no Tutor for theſe, ſinning and ſorrowing, are not his art, but his nature;</hi> though he ſhould have neither rule nor example in the world, he would find out the myſteries of iniquity, and doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough quickly to make himſelfe miſerable.</p>
                  <p>The particle, <hi>As,</hi> is a copulative in the Hebrew. So divers render it in this Text, <hi>Man is borne to trouble, And the ſparks flye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vau.</note> that is, mans trouble and ſparks flying upward, are alike naturall; we, as in divers other places, tranſlate it by way of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; <hi>Man is borne unto trouble, as, the ſparks flye upward;</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> 34. 3. <hi>The eare tryeth words, and, the mouth taſteth meate;</hi> we tranſlate the copalative by a comparative; <hi>The eare tryeth words, as the mouth taſteth meate.</hi> Againe, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 49. <hi>Every one ſhall be ſalted with fire, and every ſacrifice ſhall be ſalted with ſalt;</hi> The ſenſe lies in the ſimilitude, <hi>Every one ſhall be ſalted with fire, as every ſacrifice is ſalted with ſalt;</hi> It is an alluſion to the old ſacrifices, wherein ſalt was continually uſed; ſo here, <hi>Man</hi>

                     <hi>ones of the Eagle flye upward: Aben Ezra</hi> a learned Rabbin, makes uſe of that ſenſe alſo, and gives the gloſſe thus, <hi>as it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and innate for birds to flye, ſo it is naturall for man to ſuffer trouble.</hi> Hence obſerve, firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sorrow and ſinne, are the portion, and all the portion, that man hath by nature.</hi> He is borne to theſe.</p>
                  <p>They who are aſcended to the greateſt heights, and have got the greateſt ſtock, either of ſpirituall or outward comforts, were borne to nothing, but a cup of ſorrow, to the bread of affliction, and to the waters of adverſity: And theſe we are inſtated in, yea poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, as ſoone as we are borne; we need not waite the death of our parents for this inheritance, they devide it all to every child, and yet keep it all, to themſelves: all our real comforts are from our ſecond birth, and have their pedigree from the bleſſing and love of God. Therefore he Apoſtle puts that generall queſtion, <hi>what haſt thou, that thou haſt not received?</hi> that is, what good haſt thou? Thou haſt all thy evill from thy ſelfe, but whatſoever good thou haſt, was received from above; all our good is founded in free Grace. Secondly obſerve, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All ſinnes and ſorrowes are contained virtually, in the nature of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though a man doth not formally commit or bring forth every ſin, though a man doth not formally beare every affliction, or taſt every cup of ſorrow, yet virtually and radically a man hath every ſin in him, or it is poſſible for any ſin to be formed and ſhaped out of the nature of man: Radically alſo every man hath every affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction all ſorrowes in him; and the juſtice of God, may forme the moſt dreadfull ſhapt afflictions out of his ſins: And as the ſparke lyes cloſely in the fire, or the flint, till you ſmite or blow them up, ſo ſin lyes ſecretly in our hearts, till ſome temptation or occaſion ſmites and brings it out.</p>
                  <p>Againe we may obſerve, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man can ſin without a teacher.</hi> You need not inſtruct him, or teach him to doe evill, He doth that by a naturall inſtinct, ſince his nature was corrupted. He ſins as the ſparks fly upwards, or as a bird flyes in the ayre, whom no man directs, how to uſe her wings,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40455:118"/> 
                     <hi>Nature. is her rute.</hi> There needs much teaching againſt ſin, and it is the buſineſſe of all the Ordinances to bridle us from acting our corruptions: But man walkes in the ways of wickedneſs, without guide or precept.</p>
                  <p>It was the ancient error of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that the ſin of man came only by imitation: they denied that man had a ſtock of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in his nature, or that his nature was corrupted; but, ſeeing others ſin, he ſinned; an opinion which carries its condemnation in its own face, as wel as in our hearts. And though ſimilitudes are no proofs, yet, the reaſon of a ſimilitude is: mans ſinning is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compared to a ſparks flying, to ſhew how naturally he ſins. A ſpark flyes upward without any to lead it the way; and a bird would flye, though ſhe ſhould never ſee another bird flye: And if a man could live ſo, as never to ſee any one example of ſin all his dayes, yet that man, out of his own heart, might bring forth every ſin, every day. Example quickens and encourages the principles of ſin within us, but we can ſin without any extrinſick motion or provocation, without pattern or preſident from without. Laſtly obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To ſin, is no burden or labour to a natural man:</hi> For it is his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is no paines to the ſparke, to flye upwards: what we doe naturally, we doe eaſily. Holy duties are no burdens to a godly man, becauſe, through grace, he doth them naturally; he hath an inward principle, which dictates the law of holines to him, though he ſhould want outward teaching: <hi>He hath an unction from the holy Ghoſt, and knoweth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20. Not that a godly man becomes like God, Omniſcient, or knowing all, for at moſt we know, here, but in part: but he knows all things neceſſary, and ſo farre as neceſſary: his new birth teaches him: He lives not meerely upon the outward teaching, he hath both light &amp; liberty in himſelf; and ſo hath a tendency to theſe things in his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as there is a tendency in fire to aſcend.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould wonder and rejoyce, to ſee how grace conquers the courſe of ſinful nature. The new man is born to mercy and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to grace and glory, as the <hi>ſparks fly upward.</hi> Hence it is ſaid, <hi>He that is born of God, cannot commit ſin, for the ſeed of God remaineth in him.</hi> As, the ſparke cannot flye downward, becauſe the heate of fire remaines in it: The Apoſtle affirmes it, of himſelfe and his Fellow-labourers in the Goſpell, <hi>we can doe nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13. 8. The poſſibilities and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40455:119"/> of a regenerate man, are directly oppoſite to thoſe of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man: The one cannot ſin, the other cannot but ſin: the one can doe nothing againſt the truth the other can doe nothing for the truth; gracious acts become as naturall, as ſinfull, when nature is changed from ſin to grace. What a bleſſed change is this, that man ſhould doe good as readily, as once he did evill; that, he who was borne free to iniquity, ſhould be re-borne free to righteouſneſs, as the ſparke; flye upward. <hi>A godly man is a heavenly ſparke:</hi> He hath a fire in his nature, which carries him upward for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus having opened theſe two verſes, being the grounds of the following exhortation; let us now examine the matter of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation it ſelfe, contained in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe.</p>

                  <p>There are two opinions about the meaning of theſe words; Some conceive, that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks in high contempt of <hi>Job:</hi> and I may give you their ſenſe, by that proud ſchooling, which the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee gave the poor Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. As that Phariſee inſulted over the publican, thus, <hi>I thank God, I am not ſuch a one as thou art, &amp;c. but I faſt, and I pray, &amp;c.</hi> So, they repreſent <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here inſulting over <hi>Job, I thank God, I am not ſuch an impatient perſon as thou art, no ſuch rude curſer of my day, or complainer of my trouble; I am not (I thank God) ſo diſtracted, and ſo diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered as thou art; and if I had been in thy caſe, I ſhould have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more wit, and grace too, then, to do, as thou haſt done; I ſhould never have been ſo vaine and fooliſh, ſo forgetfull of my own duty or the Lords Soveraignty, as, to cry out againſt and accuſe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and dealings with me, to lay about me like a mad man, as thou haſt done; no, I would have ſonght unto God, and committed my cauſe unto him, this ſhould have been my courſe, ſuch and ſuch the frame and temper of my ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I rather take theſe words in a good ſenſe, implying much ſweetneſſe and meekneſſe of ſpirit in <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> And ſo this verſe is as an application of the Doctrine, contained in the former two; As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Seeing matters ſtand thus in themſelves and theſe are undoubted truths, that afflictions come from our</hi>

                     <hi>ſelves, and that our ſinnes are our own: and ſeeing thy caſe ſtands thus, that now thou art under great afflictions and troubles; I doe aſſure thee my loving friend</hi> Job, <hi>were I in thy condition (I will give thee faithfull counſell, and tell thee my heart, what I would doe) I would no longer ſtay complaining againſt my day, curſing creatures, diſtempering my head, and diſquieting my heart with theſe paſſions; but, I would even goe and addreſſe my ſelfe unto God, I would apply my ſelfe to Heaven, I would ſeeke for remedy there, earth affords it not.</hi> I have ever found this the way to eaſe my heart when burdened; to aſſwage my ſorrowes, when encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; to compoſe my ſpirit, when diſtracted; to ſtrengthen my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, when unſetled: I can give thee this rule with (A <hi>Probatum est)</hi> an aſſurance from mine own experience, in the uſe of it, and with clearneſſe of conſcience, that it is my purpoſe in ſuch caſes to uſe it ever.</p>

                     <hi>prayer, or I would commit my cauſe unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The committing of our cauſe to God, notes a reſignation of our ſelves and of our condition into the hands of God: It is as much as to ſay, Let God doe what he will, or determine what he pleaſeth concerning me, I will not ſtrive or contend about, queſtion or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his deciſion or judgement of my cauſe: I will lay my ſelfe down at his feet, and tell him how ſhe caſe ſtands with me; then, let him doe with me, what ſeems good in his eyes: This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of our cauſe, and condition unto God. And the Originall word here uſed for God, doth very well ſuite and correſpond with this ſenſe; <hi>I will commit my cauſe unto God, unto Elohim,</hi> the great and impartiall Judge of Heaven and earth; the God who loves Judgement, and the habitation of whoſe Throne is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes: The God who knowes how to diſcern exactly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween cauſe and cauſe, perſon and perſon, and will undoubtedly give a righteous ſentence concerning every cauſe and perſon, that comes before him. Unto this <hi>Elohim</hi> would I commit my cauſe, and refer my ſelf to his arbitration.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve firſt in the general; <hi>Eliphaz</hi> having reproved <hi>Job,</hi> turnes himſelf to counſell and exhortation; From which we may learne, That</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:40455:120"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>As it is our duty to reprove a fault in our brother, ſo it is our duty to adviſe and counſell him how to amend, or come out of that fault, for which we reprove him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not enough to eſpy an error, but we muſt labour to rectifie it; or, to tell another that he is out of the way, but we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reduce him. Many can eſpy faults and failings in others, who either know not how, or care not to reforme and helpe them out. Secondly obſerve, That.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a duty to exhort and excite our bretheren to thoſe duties, wherein we find them flack or negligent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> conceived, that <hi>Job</hi> was much behind in the duty of prayer and ſelf-reſignation unto God, and therefore he quickens him up to it. The Apoſtle calls us to this Chriſtian inſpection <hi>(Heb.</hi> 3. 13.) <hi>Exhort one another daily, lest any of you be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne;</hi> ſin growing and getting ſtrength, hardens the heart; it is beſt to oppoſe it betimes, and therefore he bids them doe it at all times, <hi>exhort one another daily.</hi> Though the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12.) was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the Saints eſtabliſhment <hi>in the preſent truth,</hi> yet (ſaith he) <hi>I will not ceaſe to put you alwayes in remembrance of theſe things.</hi> It is a dangerous error (which ſome hold) that the Saints in this life may out grow counſell and exhortation; as if there were no need, to bid a godly man pray &amp; ſeek unto God, no need to bid a godly man repent, or humble himſelf, or believe, he cannot but do theſe things (ſay they) theſe are connaturall to him. They are indeed to the new man, within him: But let them withall remember, that the neglect of all theſe duties, is as connaturall to the old man within him. While there are two men within us, we had need every man to look, not only to one, but to one another. It may goe ill with the better part, <hi>the new man,</hi> if while he hath an enemy within to oppoſe him, he hath not a friend without to help him. On this ground (beſides the command of Chriſt) the holieſt man on earth, may be exhorted, to look to his holineſſe: none are in more danger then they, who think they are paſt danger And, as it is a certaine argument, that a man was never good, if he deſires not to be better; ſo, it is a great argument, that a man was never good, who feares not that he may be worſe, They who are truly aſſured they cannot fall from grace, are aſſured alſo that they may fall in grace, and fall into ſin: The foundation of God ſtands ſure, but the footing of man doth not and therefore, <hi>Let him</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:40455:121"/> 
                     <hi>that ſtands, take heed leaſt he fall:</hi> And let them who ſee their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, heedleſly falling, lend them the right hand of exhortation to raiſe them up againe: and when they are careleſſe of, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring from the Lord leade them by the hand of counſell, into ways where he may be found. <hi>I would ſeeke unto God.</hi> Obſerve in the third place; That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We ought to manage our exhortations with meekneſſe and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is a mild and tender expreſſion; and to make it more eaſie he puts the exhortation (as was noted before) in the firſt, not in the ſecond perſon; he doth not ſay, ſeeing afflictions come not from the ground, and that man is borne unto trouble, therefore doe thou ſeeke unto God, and doe thou commit thy cauſe unto God; but ſeeing thy caſe is thus, truly brother, I adviſe thee as I would adviſe mine own ſoul, <hi>Seek unto God.</hi> It moves ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gaines upon the affection of another, to tell him, we would do the things our ſelves, which we deſire he ſhould, and we wiſh him, as we doe our own ſouls. Fourthly, obſerve, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is both our wiſedome and our duty in all our afflictions to ſeek unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz)</hi> if I were in thy caſe, ſeek unto God. Unto whom ſhould we goe, but unto God? He is our beſt friend, when it is beſt with us, and he is our only friend, when it is ill with us: all other friends will be Phyſitians of no value, as <hi>Job</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe found them, therefore <hi>ſeeke unto God.</hi> As the Diſciples ſaid unto Chriſt, when Chriſt asked them, <hi>Will yee alſo goe away? Whether ſhall we goe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for thou hast the words of eternall life?</hi> So faith the ſoule in afflictions, To whom ſhall I goe? Unto this creature or that creature, unto this friend or that friend? No, I will ſeek unto God, That is the wiſeſt and ſhorteſt courſe: all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſes are about, if not in vain. Other wayes may be uſed as helps, but this muſt; <hi>pitch mainly upon God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we are directed to ſeek unto God in afflictions, it ſpeakes foure things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſeek unto God about the cauſe of our afflictions, deſire that God would informe us, what his mind is in ſending ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, or what it is he aimes at, in ſending it. <hi>Afflictions are the Lords meſſengers, and we ſhould never be quiet, till we know their errand.</hi> This is it which <hi>Job</hi> complained of in the third Chapter, <hi>That his way was hid,</hi> which was expounded, that he knew not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40455:121"/> the cauſe of his afflictions, the cauſe was hidden; and ſo was the iſſue, he could neither tell how he came in nor how he could come out; If our way in afflictions be hid, we muſt ſeeke unto God for the opening of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To ſeek unto God</hi> for ſtrength and patience, to beare the affliction. As the affliction comes from God, ſo doth the ſtrength, by which we ſtand under it, or get victory over it</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>To ſeek unto God</hi> for the ſanctifying of affliction to our profit, that we may be partakers of his holineſſe. Afflictions are the good creatures of God, and they (as all other creatures) are ſanctif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed to us, by the word and prayer. We have as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſeek unto God for a bleſſing upon our <hi>daily Rod,</hi> as upon our <hi>daily bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Seek unto God</hi> for cure and eaſe, for the removing or mitigating of them. <hi>In their affliction they will ſeeke me early,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. But, for what will they ſeek? even, for medicine and healing. <hi>Come and let us returne unto the Lord: for he hath torne, and he will heale us, he hath ſmitten and he will bind us up, Hoſ.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve from the other branch, <hi>And unto God would I commit my cauſe;</hi> That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a very great eaſe unto the ſoule in affliction, to commit our cauſe unto God, and to put our affairs into his hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man is not able to ſtand alone, under the weight of his afflictions. Both ſinne and ſorrow are burdens too heavie for us to beare: if you would have eaſe, lay both upon Chriſt, it is no unbecomming boldneſſe to doe ſo, for, he cals us to it, and bids us doe it, Pſal. 55. 22. <hi>Caſt thy burden upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtaine thee.</hi> Chriſt is willing to beare a part and put his ſhoulder under theſe burdens, yea, it is his ſtrength that beares the whole. The committing of our cauſe to God, is at once our duty, our ſafety, and our eaſe. Thus <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 142, 2. <hi>I powred my complaint before him, I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him my trouble. David</hi> brought out his evils and ſet them (as it were) one, by one, in the ſight of God, and told him, thus it is with me. We may ſee <hi>David</hi> acting this rule, to the life, when <hi>Abſolom</hi> had fomented a moſt unnaturall rebellion againſt <hi>His:</hi> He haſtens out of <hi>Jeruſalem, All the Country wept with a loud voyce,</hi> and the Prieſts with the Arke of the Covenant of God came with him alſo. In what poſture was <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit, in the midſt of theſe commotions? His words to <hi>Zadok</hi> ſhew (no doubt)
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40455:122"/> the true picture of it. <hi>And the King ſaid to Zadok, carry back the Arke of God into the City, if I ſhall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me againe, and ſhew me both it and his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> but if he ſay thus, <hi>I have no delight in thee, behold, here am I, let him doe to me as ſeemeth good unto him</hi> (2 Sam. 15. 25, 26.) As if he had ſaid, I am uncertaine what God will doe with me: but I am reſolved to let the Lord doe with mee, what he will, I am willing to be, what God will have me; I lay my cauſe and leave my buſineſſe at his foot-ſtool, if he will have me dethroned and unking'd, I am content my honour ſhould lye in the duſt. If he ſay, I ſhall never come againe to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or ſee the Arke of his ſtrength and preſence, I am content for ever to be baniſht <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> never to ſee the Arke, (which to me is the moſt beautifull and deſirable ſight in the world) any more. Here was ſelf-reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and cauſe-committing to the height. And when <hi>David</hi> had brought his heart to this, his heart was unburden'd, he (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) found the weight and ſtreſſe of the whole buſineſſe lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God himſelfe, His cauſe was with God, and his cares were with God; And therefore, <hi>Though his throne ſhaked, yet his heart was fixed.</hi> Nor doe I find, that ever his heart was more fixed, then in this ſtreſſe, while his Throne and Crowne were tottering. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did the like with like ſucceſs. In the day of that great and publike calamity, he went and ſpread the letter of <hi>Rabſhakeh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> he, as it were deſired God to reade it, to obſerve the blaſphemous contents, and ſee in what condition he was. <hi>He that commits his cauſe to God, breathes a compoſed ſpirit, when the greateſt ſtormes and diſtractions are upon his bodie or eſtates, upon Church or State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only, take this caution, be ſure the cauſe you commit to God, be a good cauſe. The committing of a ſinfull cauſe to God, is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to, and a high ſtrain of preſumption againſt God. We may commit a doubtfull cauſe to God, deſiring, that he would try, and examine, whether it be good or bad. But we muſt not commit a doubtfull cauſe to God deſiring him to protect it, or us in it whether it be good or bad. And if (in this ſence) we may not commit a doubtfull cauſe to God; What ſhall we thinke of thoſe, who ſhall dare to commit an openly unjuſt. and wicked cauſe to God? A wicked mans prayer is alwayes ſinfull, but, how abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable is it, when he prayes to be proſpered or directed in acting his ſin, or to be ſtrengthned in ſuffering (impenitently) for his ſin. There
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40455:122"/> is no gracious act, but a wicked man, at one time or other, will i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate. He will pray, and repent, and forgive, and commit his cauſe to God, and when he dyes, commit his ſoule to God. There is no truſting to a mouth full of good words, while the heart will not empty it ſelfe of wickedneſſe. It is good alwayes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our cauſe and our ſoules to God, but a cauſe or a ſoule are not therefore good, becauſe committed unto God. The language of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is often ſpoken by the men of <hi>Aſhdod;</hi> And many who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the leaſt part of holineſſe in them, can yet ſet themſelves (when there is no remedie) to act a part in it. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives us this rule, (1 Epiſt. 4. 19.) <hi>Let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their ſoules to him, in well-doing, as unto a faithfull Creatour.</hi> Except we ſuffer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will (or from the hand) of God, and alſo, doe well in our ſufferings, Chriſt will not admit this Feofement, though we commit our ſelves to him, he will not accept the truſt. But he that ſuffers according to (or by) the will of God, and doth well in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, that is, hath a good cauſe, and a good conſcience, He (I ſay) may commit all to God, (and in the mercy of the moſt High) he ſhall not miſcarry.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whereas <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith, I would <hi>ſeeke unto God</hi> were I in thy caſe, obſerve, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a wiſe courſe in adviſing others, to ſhew our ſelves readie to follow the ſame adviſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It wins exceedingly upon others, to take our counſell, when it appeares we are ready to follow the ſame counſell, our ſelves. <hi>We ought to doe nothing unto others, but what we would have done unto our ſelves, and we ſhould adviſe nothing to others, but what we our ſelves would doe; It puts strength into a rule, when he that gives it, is ready to enliven it by his owne practice.</hi> As a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, for the encouragement of his patient to take a nauſeous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, will ſay to him, Sir you ſeeme unwilling to drinke it, but if I were ſicke and diſtempered, as you are, I would drinke it readily, and that you may ſee there is no hurt in it, I will taſt a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle my ſelfe; His taſting ſweetens it, and the patient likes it well. Thus when either Miniſter or private friend offers adviſe or counſell, and ſhall ſay, thus I would doe, this I would follow; This takes upon the heart: whereas it diſparages prayer or any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſay to another, <hi>Seeke unto God,</hi> put your caſe unto him, faſt and pray; When he that gives the counſell neglects all theſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40455:123"/> duties, and is careleſſe of communion with God.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaith of the Phariſees, that they bound heavy burthens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhoulders of others. Theſe burdens were counſels and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, rules, and canons; they would have men doe thus and thus, in the manner of Gods worſhip, or daily converſe with men. But, <hi>They themſelves would not touch them with one of their fingers (Mat.</hi> 23. 4.) That is, they would not practiſe them in the leaſt degree. As to do evil with <hi>both hands, (Mic.</hi> 7. 3.) notes the higheſt degree both of deſire &amp; endeavour, in doing evill: So not to touch that which is good with a finger, notes a total neglect of doing good. A finger is the leaſt member, and a Touch is the leaſt act, then theſe Phariſees not touching with a finger, imports they did not act at all. It is good to act a rule privately by way of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, before we put it upon others: but it is moſt neceſſary to act it by way of example, when we have publiſhed it to, and preſs'd it upon others. It was a ſpeech of one of the Ancients, <hi>I never taught my people any thing, but what I had first practiſed and experimented my ſelfe.</hi> Doctrine is ſooner followed by the eye, then by the eare; He that (like the Scribes and phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 3.) <hi>ſaith and doth not, ſhall find but few to doe what he ſaith.</hi> No man ought to teach any thing, which he is not willing (as he is call'd) to doe and obſerve himſelfe. It is very ſinfull to give counſell, which we will not take. <hi>Our works ought to be the practiſe of our words, and as practicable as our words.</hi> Woe unto thoſe of whom it may be ſaid, as Chriſt of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Mat. 23. 3. <hi>Whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and doe, but doe not ye after their works.</hi>

                  <p>THis context unto the 17 verſe, containes the ſecond argument, by which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſtrengthneth his former Exhortation, <hi>To ſeeke unto God and to commit his cauſe unto him.</hi> The argument may be thus formed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is to be ſought unto, both in duty, and in wiſdome, and unto him our cauſe is to be committed, who is of abſolute, infinite power, wiſdome and goodneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:40455:123"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>But God is of abſolute, infinite power, wiſdome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore it is our duty and our wiſdome to ſeeke unto God, and unto God to commit our cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That, God is infinite in power, wiſdome and goodneſſe, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> proves by an enumeration or induction of divers effects and works, which call for infinite power, wiſdome and goodneſſe to produce and actuate them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe effects are laid down, firſt in generall, v. 9. <hi>Who doth great things and unſearchable; marvellous things without number.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, theſe works or effects are given in particulars, and the firſt particular inſtance of Gods mighty power, is in naturall things, or his preſervation of the world, at the 10 <hi>verſe, Who giveth raine upon the earth, and ſendeth waters upon the fields.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond inſtance is given in civill things, or his adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, at the 12, 13, 14. verſes. And that we may conſider two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In deſtroying the counſels and plots of the wicked, in the 12, 13, and 14. verſes, <hi>He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot performe their enterpriſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In delivering thoſe who are in trouble, at the 15. verſe, <hi>He ſaveth the poore from the Sword,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are works of Power.</p>
                  <p>Further the goodneſſe of God ſhines forth in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the preſent intendment, or end aimed at, in theſe mighty works, ver. 11. <hi>To ſet up on high thoſe that be low, that thoſe which mourne may be exalted to ſafety</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the future benefit of theſe works, and that in two reſpects, <hi>verſe</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The raiſing up of their ſpirits who are oppreſſed, <hi>So the poore hath hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The confounding and ſhaming of their oppreſſours, expreſt in their ſilence, at the latter end of the 16 verſe, <hi>And iniquity ſtoppeth her mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you have a briefe account, of the ſeverall points contained in this argument, and the diſpoſition of the whole context. For the better underſtanding thereof, we will firſt conſider what might be the aime or ſcope of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> in making ſo accurate and large a deſcription of God, in his great and marvellous works, and then ſurvay theſe works in order as they are digeſted.</p>

                  <p> To the former, we may take notice of a foure-fold aime, which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> might have in deſcribing theſe works of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, plainly to aſſert the providence of God, in ordering or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing all actions and events here below: and ſo it is in proſecution of what he had ſaid in the 6 verſe, <hi>Affliction commeth not forth of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, his intent might be, to humble <hi>Job,</hi> to bridle and take downe his ſpirit, which he conceived over-bold with, and too much heightned towards the Almighty; A diſcovery whereof himſelf made in his extravagant ſpeeches before noted, in the third Chapter. <hi>The remembrance of God in his greatneſſe is one of the readieſt means to humble man:</hi> And God himſelfe tooke this way to humble <hi>Job,</hi> in the latter end of this booke, even, by a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his owne power, exemplified in many great acts and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the creation.</p>
                  <p>Or thirdly, the intent of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> might be, to ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>Job</hi> in his afflictions, by ſhewing him a God, that had done ſuch wonders, and therefore able to worke another wonder in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering and raiſing him up againe: A God, who could provide medicines for all his diſeaſes, heale all his breaches, repaire all his loſſes, ſupply all his wants, and reſolve all his doubts. <hi>To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider God in himſelfe and in his works, who he is, and what he doth, is a mighty encouragement to ſeeke unto God in our greatest extremities, in the ſaddeſt and cloudieſt day of our afflictions.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we doe any thing more prevalent, for the ſupport and reliefe of our owne ſpirits in a time, when we are loweſt, than to ſpread before the eye of our owne thoughts, the power, greatneſs, and goodneſſe of the high God, in his works and wonders.</p>
                  <p>A fourth intent in probability was to ſtop <hi>Jobs</hi> curioſity, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſo much into the reaſon of Gods dealing with him; which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> it ſeemes obſerved in the complaints of the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where <hi>Job</hi> expoſtulates, <hi>Why is light given to a man whoſe way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? Job</hi> was troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not ſee the bottome of Gods dealings with him, he could not ſee through them, either what the cauſe was, why he came into thoſe troubles, or by what iſſues, and out-lets, he ſhould eſcape thoſe troubles. Now, to ſtop <hi>Jobs</hi> curioſity in pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too far, or too boldy, into the ſecret workings of God. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> tels him, <hi>That God doth great things and unſearchable,</hi> no marvell therefore, if his wayes were hid; <hi>That he doth marvellous</hi>

                  <p> And as he finiſhes, ſo he beautifies: all his works are full of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and comelineſſe: He doth his work exquiſitely (or as we ſay) artificially; yea, thoſe works that we look upon, as full of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are full of order; and thoſe works, in which we ſee no form, or nothing but deformity, even theſe will one day appear (now they are) admirable in beauty and comelineſſe.

                  <p> No works of man or Angel, are capable of ſuch a foure-fold <hi>ſtampe</hi> as this: no, nor any one work of all the creatures put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could ever be ſtamped with any one of theſe characters, in any compariſon, with the works of God. Some, in a ſenſe, have done <hi>great things</hi> but none have done things <hi>unſearchable:</hi> Man may fathome the works of man, his cloſeſt wayes are not paſt finding out. As there was never any thing made ſo ſtrong by the ſtrength of man, but there was ſome other ſtrength in man, that could match, yea overthrow it; ſo there was never any thing ſo wiſely, ſo artificially or myſteriouſly contrived, by the skill, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and deepeſt underſtanding of a man, but that the skill know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding of another man, hath, or might have rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſearcht it out. The works of moſt men, are wrought above ground, and their intentions flote and ſwimme upon the face of their actions: And although ſome, as the Prophet ſpeakes <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 29.) <hi>worke deepe to hide their counſels</hi> (as they hope, not only from men but) <hi>from God,</hi> yet God gives other men a light, to diſcover the very loweſt hell of thoſe counſels, even, all the <hi>depths of Satan, The maſter-Engineere</hi> of thoſe mines and ſubterranean contrivances. Further, Though ſome men doe that, which makes other men (eſpecialy fooles, or men weake in knowledge) won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet no <hi>(Thaumaturgas,</hi> or) wonder-worker ever did that, which makes all men wonder. Or, if it ſhould be granted, that any have done things great, unſearchable, wonderfull, yet I am ſure, none have done theſe things <hi>without number;</hi> one great, unſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable, wonderfull work, is taske enough for one mans life: And a little skill in numbers will ſerve the turne, to caſt up, and give us the totall ſumme and number, of all the works of all men, which deſervedly beare (as mans may) the title and ſuperſcription of great, unſearchable, wonderfull.</p>
                  <p>More diſtinctly. Firſt, <hi>He doth great things.</hi> There is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes upon every thing God doth: The great God leaves (as it were) the print of his own greatneſſe, even upon thoſe things which we accont little; little works of nature, have a greatneſſe in them, conſidered as done by God, and little works of providence, have a greatneſſe in them, conſidered as done by God; If the thing which God doth, be not great in it ſelfe, yet it is great, becauſe he doth it. As there is no ſin of man little in it ſelfe (though comparatively it be (becauſe committed againſt a great God: So there is no work of God little (though comparitively it be (becauſe acted by the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40455:126"/> great God. Further, if God doth a thing, which in it ſelfe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, or conſidered according to the line and rule of the creature, is unjuſt; yet becauſe God doth it, or commands it to be done, his very doing or commanding ſtamps juſtice upon it; as is clear in the caſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> call to ſacrifice his ſon, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> carrying away the jewels of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> If then the act of God (whoſe will is the ſupream law) makes that lawfull, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common rule, is unlawfull; how much more doth the act of God make that great, which in ordinary proportion is accounted ſmall.</p>
                  <p>Againe, When it is ſaid, <hi>God doth great things,</hi> we muſt not underſtand it, as, if God dealt not about little things, or as if he let the ſmall matters of the world paſſe, and did not meddle with them: <hi>Great</hi> in this place, is not excluſive of <hi>Little,</hi> for, he doth not onely great, but ſmall, even the ſmalleſt things. The Heathens ſaid, their <hi>Jupiter</hi> had no leiſure to be preſent at the doing of ſmall <note place="margin">Non vacat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ignis rebus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe Jovi.</note> things, or it did not become him to attend them. God attendeth the doing of ſmall things, and it is his honour to doe ſo: the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Sparrow to the ground, is one of the ſmalleſt things that is, yet that is not without the providence of God; the haires of our head are ſmall things, yet as not too many, ſo not too ſmall for the great God to take notice of; Chriſt aſſures us this, <hi>The very haires of your head are all numbred,</hi> Mat. 10. 29, 30. We ought highly to adore and reverence the power and inſpection of God, about the loweſt, the meaneſt things and actions. Is it not with the <hi>great God,</hi> as with <hi>great men,</hi> or, as it was with that <hi>great man Moſes,</hi> who had ſuch a burthen of buſineſſe in the government of that people upon his ſhoulders, that he could not bear it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father in law adviſeth him, to call in the aide of others and divide the work: But how? The great matters, the weighty and knotty controverſies muſt be brought to <hi>Moſes;</hi> but the petty differences and leſſer cauſes, are tranſmitted and handed over to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour judges; <hi>And it ſhall be, that every great matter, they ſhall bring unto thee, but every ſmall matter they ſhall judge,</hi> Exod. 18. 22. But God, the great Judge of Heaven and earth, hath not onely the great and weighty, but ſmall matters brought unto him; the leaſt motions of the creature, are heard and reſolved, diſpoſed and guided by his wiſdome and power.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, What is this greatneſſe, and what are theſe great things? I ſhall hint an anſwer to both, for the clearing of the words.</p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:40455:127"/>
                  <p> There is a two-fold greatneſſe upon the works of God. There is (ſo we may diſtinguiſh) Firſt, the greatneſſe of quantity; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the greatneſſe of quality or vertue: That work of God which is greateſt in the bulk or quantity of it is the work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; How ſpacious, huge and mighty a fabrique is Heaven and earth, with all things compacted and comprehended in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference! And in this work, ſo vaſt for quantity, what admirable qualities are every where intermixt! Matter and forme, power and order, quantity and quality, are ſo equally ballanced, that no eye can diſcerne, or judgement of man determine, which weighes moſt in this mighty work.</p>
                  <p>Yet among theſe works of God, ſome are called great in regard of quality, rather then of quantity. As it is ſaid <hi>(Gen.</hi> 1. 16.) That <hi>God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day and the leſſer light to rule the night.</hi> (Sunne and Moone) theſe are great lights, not that there are no lights great but theſe, or that both theſe are greater, then all other heavenly lights; for many Stars are greater then the Moon, as the doctrine and obſervation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomers aſſures us; but the leſſer of theſe is great in regard of light and influence, excellency and uſefulneſſe to the world.</p>
                  <p>And as to theſe works of creation, ſo the works of providence, are great works: When God deſtroyes great enemies, the greatneſſe of his work is proclaimed.

                  <p>The Spirituall works of God, are yet far greater; the work of redemption, is called <hi>a great ſalvation,</hi> the converſion and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſinner, the pardon of our ſinnes, and the purifying of

                  <p> And if it be the property of God to doe great things, then, it is a duty in us, to expect great things. We ought to look for ſuch things, as come up to, and anſwer the power and greatneſs of God; we diſhonour, and as it were, humble God, when we look onely for low and meane things; <hi>Great expectations from God, honour the greatneſſe of God.</hi> As the Lord expects to receive the greateſt ſervices from us, becauſe he is a great King, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14. So we ought to expect, that we ſhall receive the greateſt mercies from the Lord, becauſe he is a great King; <hi>It diſhonours God as much and more, when we believe little, as when we doe little.</hi> A great King thinks himſelfe diſhonoured, if you aske him a petty ſuite; he looks more what becomes him to give, or doe in bounty, then the petitioner to aske in neceſſity. The Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> could tell his ſuiter (whom he had more aſtoniſht, then relieved with his favour) That though the thing might be too great for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, yet it was not too great for <hi>Alexander</hi> to give. <hi>If dust and aſhes can ſpeake and think at this rate, O how large is the heart of God!</hi> Then, it is not onely our priviledge, but our duty to aske and believe great things; we ought to have a great faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God doth great things; Is it becomming, to have <hi>a great God,</hi> and <hi>a little faith?</hi> To have a God that doth great things, and we to be a people (his people) that cannot believe great things? nay, To have a God who can eaſily doe great things, and we a people, that can hardly believe ſmall things? How unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! if ſome ſmall thing be to be done, then uſually faith is upon the wing, but if it be a great thing, then faith is clogg'd, her wings are clipt, and we at a ſtand; why ſhould it be ſaid unto us, as, Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>O ye of little faith.

                  </p>
                  <p>There is another uſefull conſequence from this truth. <hi>He that doth great works, ought to have great praiſes.</hi> As, we ought to have great faith, that he will doe great things, ſo, he ought to have great acknowledgments, when he hath done great things. Shall God doe great things for us, and ſhall we give him ſome poor, leane, ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſacrifices of praiſe? It is very obſervable, that, as ſoon as the Prophet had deſcribed the Lord in his greatneſſe <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 40. 15.)
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40455:128"/> he adds in the very next verſe, <hi>And Lebanon is not ſufficient to burne, nor the beasts thereof, ſufficient for a burnt Offering.</hi> That is, no ſervices are great enough, for this great God. <hi>Lebanon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in ſpices for Incenſe and perfume; it abounded with cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell for Sacrifice and burnt offerings; To ſay that <hi>Lebanon</hi> had not ſpice enough to burne for incenſe, nor beaſts enough to burne for Sacrifice, ſhews the Lord far exalted in greatneſſe, above all the praiſes and holy ſervices of his people.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſeeing God doth great works for us, let us ſhew great zeale for, great love unto the Lord.

God is in working (and ſo are men, the hand cannot act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the head) as he is in underſtanding. <hi>There is no ſearching of his underſtanding (Iſa.</hi> 40. 28.) Therefore there is none of his working.</p>
                  <p>This unſearchableneſſe of the works of God, may be conſidered two wayes.</p>

                  <p>There are ſome works of God, which are not to be ſearched into, <note place="margin">Arcana imperij.</note> they are to be adored by believing, not to be pryed into by ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; and in that ſence they are called unſearchable <hi>(Rom.</hi> 11. 33.)
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40455:129"/> 
                     <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdome of and knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his judgements!</hi> Many of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is, his works of judgement, are ſo unſearchable, that it is not induſtry or duty, but preſumption, to ſearch into them. As thoſe <hi>unſpeakable words,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> heard in the third heavens, were ſuch as (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4.) <hi>is not lawfull for a man to utter;</hi> ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable judgements may be interpreted ſuch, as is not lawfull for a man to ſearch. Great Princes will not have all their actions ſcann'd, at leaſt, not by all, <hi>They keep ſtate in their works.</hi> If all a mans actions be levell to the loweſt, his perſon will be ſo too. The reaſon why the works of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> were to be ſo myſterious and miraculous, is, becauſe he was to be adored and <hi>Godded, to be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above all</hi> (in man) <hi>that is called God, or that is worſhipped,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. They who aſpire to divine honour, have, or at leaſt pretend to have many ſecrets. Becauſe <hi>ſecret things belong unto God, things revealed unto man (Deut.</hi> 29. 29.) And as the Angell at once anſwers and reproves <hi>Manoah (Judg.</hi> 13. 18.) <hi>Why askeſt thou after my name, ſeeing it is ſecret, or wonderfull?</hi> As if he had ſaid, thou muſt not enquire after my name, for it is a ſecret. Such prying into the works of God, is as dangerous, as <hi>prying into the Arke of God</hi> (1 Sam. 6. 19.) <hi>It were more profitable for us, and more honourable to God, if we did ſearch our own ſecret wayes more, and Gods leſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are other works of God, which cannot be ſearched, yet we may and ought to ſearch them. It is our duty to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy them, though we cannot finde them. We may ſearch and finde many of the workes of God, with our ſences; there are others which we cannot finde, though we ſearch for them, with our reaſon and underſtanding. As ſome parts of the word of God (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16.) So ſome part of his works are ſo <hi>hard to be underſtood, that unſtable men wreſt them to their own destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The minde of God is legible in very many of his works, and we may read them without a Comment or Interpreter. Other of his works are myſterious and aenigmaticall, very riddles, inſomuch, that if an ordinary man looking on them, ſhould be queſtioned, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandeſt thou what thou ſeeſt;</hi> he muſt anſwer, as the Eunuch did <hi>Phillip, How can I except ſome man teach me.</hi> And theſe works are unſearchable, two ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in regard of the manner of doing; we cannot finde out the wayes and contrivances of Gods work. <hi>His wayes are in the</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:40455:129"/> 
                     <hi>deep, and his foot-ſteps are not known,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, that is, the way which God goes to the accompliſhing of his ends, are oftentimes like ſteps upon the water, which leave no impreſſion or track behind them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, his works are unſearchable in their cauſes or ends; what it is which God aimes at, or intends, what moves or provokes him to ſuch a courſe, is uſually a ſecret. He doth ſuch things, as no man can give an account of, or render a reaſon, why. <hi>Peter</hi> knew not how to conſtrue or expound that work of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 13. when he took a Towell with a baſon of water, to waſh his feet. Therefore Chriſt tells him, <hi>What I doe thou knoweſt not</hi> (that is, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not, what moves me to doe this, for his eye taught him what Chriſt did) <hi>but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</hi> In due time this ſhall be interpreted to thee, and thou ſhalt know the reaſon, why I did this.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſaid (and that may be an objection againſt both text and Expoſition) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 2. <hi>The workes of the Lord are great, ſought out of all thoſe, that have pleſure therein.</hi> To ſeek out, notes a full diſcovery. And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 7. <hi>Failing</hi> in this, is charged upon the fathers, and confeſſed by the children, as a fault, <hi>Our fathers underſtood not thy wonders,</hi> that is, the great things which God did for them in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> How then is it ſaid here, The works of the Lord are <hi>great and unſearchable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To clear this, Firſt, I ſay there are ſome great works of God, which are eaſie and plaine; And it is our duty to be acquainted with, and learned in theſe works of God, as well as in the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thoſe works whoſe text is hard, we muſt ſearch and labour to expound them, ſo, as to further duty, but not to feed our curioſity; We may ſearch them with ſubmiſſion to the mind of God, not for ſatisfaction, onely, to our own minds. We may ſearch with deſire to honour God, but not to humour our ſelves. We may ſearch them to make us more holy, though not barely to make us, more knowing. Take two Corolaries from this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if the works of God are unſearchable, then how unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are the counſells of God; the deep and ſecret counſels of God! <hi>The works of God are the couſells of God made viſible.</hi> Every work of God is the bringing of ſome counſell of God to light. Now if we are not able to find out his counſells when they are made viſible in his works; how ſhall we find out his counſells, when they lye hidden in his breaſt?</p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:40455:130"/>
                  <p> Secondly, If the works of God are unſearchable, then, we are to ſubmit unto the diſpenſations of God, whatſoever they are, though we are not able according to reaſon, to give an account of them; though we cannot ſearch out either the manner how, or the cauſe for which they were done, yet we muſt reverence them; And what we cannot believe by knowing, we muſt know by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. It is our duty, not onely to <hi>winke and believe, ſhut our eyes and believe,</hi> or believe when we cannot ſee; but, we muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten believe, where knowledge is ſhut out, <hi>believe when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand. Abraham</hi> by faith followed the call of God, <hi>not knowing whether he went,</hi> Heb. 11. 8. It is dangerous to follow men blind-fold (how ſeeing ſoever thoſe men are) but it is ſafe, and our duty to follow God blindfold, how ſeeing ſoever we think our ſelves to be. We muſt not be diſpleaſed (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was at <hi>Jacob</hi> his Father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 17.) when we ſee God laying his right hand upon <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and his left upon <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> doing things croſſe to our thoughts; much leſſe may we take upon us to direct the hand of God, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> would <hi>Jacobs,</hi> where we pleaſe. The Lord knows (as <hi>Jacob</hi> anſwered <hi>Joſeph)</hi> what he doth, and it becomes us to acquieſce in what he doth, though we know it not. Some <hi>Romiſh Paraſites,</hi> have ſaid of the <hi>Pope, That if he ſhould carry thouſands to hell along with him, there is no man muſt ſay to him, Sir, why doe you ſo?</hi> They adore him ſo in the unſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chableneſſe of his wayes and doings, that it is enough for them, if he doth them.</p>
                  <p>This abominable flattery of that <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> is a ſober truth concerning the <hi>holy God; Though God eaſt thouſands of ſoules into hell, no man may ſay to him, what doſt thou?</hi> And though God turne Kingdomes upſide down, though he ſend great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon his own people, and make them a reproach unto the <hi>Heathen,</hi> though he give them up unto the power of the adverſary and make all their enemies to rejoyce, yet no man may ſay unto God, why doe you thus; His works are unſearchable. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the line of a creature, to put any queſtion, <hi>A why or A where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> about the work of the <hi>Greatour. Shall the thing formed ſay unto him that formes it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over his clay?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some think they could doe things better then God hath done, or at leaſt that God might have done better; if they had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in their hands, things ſhould not goe thus and thus; What an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40455:130"/> indignity is this, to the wiſdome and power of God, that He whoſe works are unſearchable ſhould be made accountable for his works? That of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when he was in a deep medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the nature of God, may well be applied to the works of God, who walking by the ſea ſide in deepe thoughts of God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard this voyce, or was filled with this thought, <hi>That he might as ſoone empty the ſea with, or comprehend the Ocean in one of thoſe little cockle-ſhels, which lay on the ſhore, as with the narrow veſſell of his Spirit, comprehend the infinite greatneſſe of the God of Spirits.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly from our ſenſe: not that marvels are inviſible, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and miracles, are wrought to be ſeen, and the uſe of them lies in this, from the ſence to confirme faith, or to convince of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe. Which (by the way) quite overthrowes the Popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of a miracle, in their ſuppoſed tranſubſtantiation of the bread at the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> who tell us of a miracle, but can ſhew us none. But though in all miracles and marvails the thing wrought is plain to the ſences, yet both the power and manner of doing it, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the ſences, <hi>The marvell wrought is ſeene, but the working of the marvell is not ſeen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Marvels</hi> are ſeperated or removed from our imitation; we cannot doe ſuch things. The Lord ſtands alone working won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They are ſeperated part and portion for God himſelf. The <hi>Egyptian Sorcerers</hi> ſeemed to doe by their devilliſh inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what <hi>Moſes</hi> did by the command and power of God: But at the beſt they did but ſeeme to doe like <hi>Moſes,</hi> and preſently they could not ſo much as ſeeme, Exod. 8. 18. <hi>And the Magicians did ſo,</hi> (that is, they attempted to doe ſo) <hi>but they could not.

                  </p>
                  <p>Further, the word alſo ſignifies ſometimes, <hi>A hard or a difficult thing,</hi> becauſe thoſe things that are very hard and difficult have ſomewhat of wonder in them, and cauſe us to wonder at them, Deut. 17. 8. <hi>If a matter come which is too hard,</hi> the word is, <hi>which is too marvellous and wonderfull for thee,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>Is any thing too hard for me</hi> (ſaith God) the word is, <hi>Is any thing wonderfull to me? Nothing is wonderfull to us, but that which is too hard for us. There is nothing wonderfull to God, who doth all wonders, and is himſelfe all Wonder.</hi> It hath beene ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe lovers of and ſearchers after ſecret wiſedome, called <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> that it <hi>doth not become a Philoſopher to wonder:</hi> For admiration is uſually the daughter of ignorance; we marvell at moſt things, becauſe we know the cauſes of few things. It was therefore a ſhame for a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> to wonder, becauſe it betrayed his ignorance; who would be thought ſtudied in, yea a maſter of all cauſes, and able to give a reaſon of all things in nature. But it is moſt certaine, the great God never marvelleth at any thing; <hi>For is any thing too hard for me,</hi> ſaith the Lord. Wonders are things too hard for us, and the ſame word ſignifies a <hi>wonder and a thing, too hard.</hi>

If <hi>England</hi> finding (as now it doth) her children ſtrugling in her wombe, ſhould goe enquire of the Lord as <hi>Rebecca</hi> did; <hi>(Gen.</hi> 25. 22.) <hi>why is it thus?</hi> The Lord may anſwere, as he did to her, <hi>Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in thy wombe, and two manner of people ſhall be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted frem thee.</hi> A Nation fearing God, and a Nation blaſpheming God, a Nation ſeeking Reformation, and a Nation oppoſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God work mervailes and we believe him not, hath he not reaſon to marvell at our unbeliefe; Chriſt having wrought miracles to gaine the beliefe of his country men, <hi>marvailed at their unbeliefe, Mark.</hi> 6. 2, 6. Unbeliefe is a great ſin at all times,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40455:133"/> but in a time when mervailes are wrought for the cure and healing of it; unbeleefe is a marvellous ſin. Will not Chriſt, think you, marvell at our unbeleefe, if we beleeve not after all theſe marvels? <hi>Ye will not beleeve</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, and he rebukes the Jewes for it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.) <hi>except you ſee ſignes and wonders:</hi> Surely if they were ſo charged, becauſe they would not beleeve, except they ſaw ſignes and wonders, how ſhall they be charged, who will not beleeve, when they ſee ſignes and wonders, eſpecially when God ſeemes to work a wonder a purpoſe, that they might beleeve? <hi>God loves and prizes the faith of man ſo highly, that ſometimes he bids a miracle for it, rather then goe without it.</hi> And ſurely now, as God hath wrought marvels, to abate the marvellous pride of the Adverſary, ſo, to overcome the marvellous unbeleef of his own people: As hath been obſerved concerning the Lords ſwearing, <hi>As I live I deſire not the death of a ſinner, &amp;c.</hi> O happy man, for whoſe ſake the Lord ſweares; but O moſt unhappy, who doeſt not beleeve the Lord, when he ſweares. So, we may ſay of the Lords-wonder-workings: O happy people for whom the Lord works wonders; but O moſt unhappy people, who beleeve not the Lord, when he works wonders.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Seeing God works extraordinary things for us, let not us ſtay in ordinary duties.</hi> Let our works have ſomewhat of a marvell in them too? Let our repentance, and the change of our lives be marvelous; let our zeal &amp; courage for Chriſt be marvelous; like that of the Apoſtles, who carried themſeves with ſuch heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal magnanimity, in the work of the Goſpel; that when the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt and Councel (who had convented and threatned them) ſaw their boldneſſe, <hi>They marvelled,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 13. Let our love and thankfullneſſe be marvellous, let us pray marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, and believe marvellouſly; marvels don by God, ſhould ever work faith in man: And faith in man, doth ſometime work mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in God. Chriſt ſpeakes with a kind of admiration to the woman of <hi>Canaan, O woman great is thy faith,</hi> Mat. 15. 28. O that his people in this Nation, would ſet <hi>Him,</hi> thus a wondring once more, <hi>O</hi> England <hi>great is the faith in me! O</hi> England <hi>great is thy love to me! O</hi> England, <hi>great is thy zeale for me! O</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>great is thy repentance, exceeding glorious thy Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will cloſe this point with this one word. God hath begun to doe ſo many marvels amongſt us, that I verily believe, the work he
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40455:133"/> is about, will end in a marvel too: and we in the cloſe ſhall be made either <hi>a wonder of mercy, or a wonder of judgement to all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's round about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Attribute of the works of God, raiſes the glory of them all. They are innumerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He doth marvellous things without number.</hi> The Hebrew word for word is; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill there be no number: Without number</hi> may be taken three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Strictly and abſolutely, for that which is without number; and thus there is no number innumerable: Things abſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number would be infinite; but there cannot be two Infinits: <hi>As God is ſo One, and without number, that he is Infinite; ſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever could be ſo many, that it were without number, would be infinite too.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Without number,</hi> is that which man cannot reckon or caſt up the ſumme of it. <hi>(Rev.</hi> 7. 9.) <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>a great multitude, which no man could number:</hi> As a ſmall number is ſaid to be ſuch, <hi>as a child may write,</hi> Iſa. 10. 19. So ſuch a multitude as a man cannot write, notes the greateſt number. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. there is mention made of <hi>an innumerable company of Angels:</hi> So God calleth <hi>Abraham</hi> out, and ſaith <hi>Look now towards Heaven, and tell the Starres, if thou be able to number them, Gen.</hi> 12. The Starrs are innumerable, that is, beyond mans Arithmetique.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Things are ſaid to be without number, or innumerable (in a more common ſenſe) when they are a very great number; and ſo we find it frequent in Scripture: As that which is very high is ſaid to be as high as heaven: Thus the diſcouraging Spies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Cities of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> to be <hi>Cities walled up to Heaven, Deut.</hi> 1. 28. And when Sea-men or Marriners are toſſed upon the waves and billowes of the Sea, they are ſaid, <hi>to mount up to the Heaven, and to goe downe againe to the depths,</hi> Pſal. 107. 26. So here a very great number, is ſaid to be innumerable or without number: In this third, and in that ſecond ſenſe, the great works of God are innumerable: God hath done ſo many marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things, as are inpoſſible for man to reckon. His mighty works are not only beyond the writing of a child, but of the wiſeſt men: The man who numbers moſt dayes, cannot number the wonders of God.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall note but one or two Inſtructions from this That the works of God are innumerable. Firſt <hi>Then, what God hath</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:40455:134"/> 
                     <hi>done, he can doe it againe a ſecond time, yea a third, a fourth time, ten times, yea ten thouſand times over, if our neceſſity and his good pleaſure meet together, for his works are innumerable: Eliphaz</hi> ſpeakes not only of what God had done, but of what he can doe, yea of what he is a doing; <hi>he doth innumerable marvels.</hi> Some men can doe great things, many have done great things, but they cannot doe them without number; even a child may write all that any man can doe, and at moſt it needs but a man to reckon all the great things, which all men have done. The hand of God ſhortens not in an eternity, but the hand of man ſhortens every day, ſometimes in a day, and therefore he cannot doe things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable: Man cannot doe that to day which he could yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, whether we reſpect his civill abilities, or his naturall. As old <hi>Barzillai</hi> ſaid unto <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. when the King invited him home with him, and offered him all the pleaſures of the Court, <hi>Can I any more heare the voice of ſinging men and ſinging wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? or can I any more taſt what I eate and what I drinke?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, It is true, Sir, I have known the time when I could have made uſe of this royall favor, and have taken in the pleaſures of your Court; I once delighted in muſick, and my eare could taſt a ſweet voice; I once delighted in rich fare, and my pall at could taſt meate and drinke, but can I any more doe thus? my naturall ſtrength is gone, my ſenſes cannot renew innumerable acts of pleaſure: <hi>if grace doth not weane us from the abuſe, yet nature will tire, in the uſe of worldly comforts.</hi> But the civill abilities of man wither ſooner then his naturall; you may ſee a man, that hath done great things in a State or Common-wealth; come to him a while after, and he may ſay, <hi>Can I any more doe thoſe things?</hi> I am not what I was, my power is gone: But come to God, after he hath done this or that, and a thouſand great things, he will not ſay, <hi>can I helpe you any more?</hi> can I deliver you any more? can I deſtroy your enemies, can I diſcover their plots and counſels any more? yes Lord, as thy works are unſearchable, ſo they are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and thou canſt doe them for evermore. The Lord ſaith ſometime to a people, as he did to <hi>Iſrael (Judg.</hi> 10. 13.) in anger, <hi>I will deliver you no more?</hi> But he never ſaith to any people out of weakneſſe, <hi>I can deliver you no more: Pſal.</hi> 78. The people provoked God by making a queſtion of this <hi>(ver.</hi> 20.) <hi>Behold</hi> (ſay they) <hi>he ſmote the rock, that the waters guſhed out, and the ſtreames overflowed,</hi> (we acknowledge that God hath done a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40455:134"/> marvell) <hi>but can he give bread alſo? can he provide fleſh for his people?</hi> ſurely he cannot doe this marvell alſo: what ſaith the text? <hi>The Lord heard this, and was wroth, ſo a fire was kindled againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>and anger alſo came up againſt Iſrael:</hi> What doe you think that I can doe but one great thing? that I have but one bleſſing, but one deliverance, but one wonder? Know that I who ſmote the rock, can provide you fleſh; I who gave you water, can give you bread, I who have diſcovered one wicked plot of the enemy, can diſcover all; I who have given you one victory, can give you a thouſand; I who have given you one deliverance, can give you innumerable deliverances; Therefore take heed of ſetting bounds to God, <hi>of limiting the Holy one of Iſrael: Men love not to be limited, but God ought not.</hi> We at once provoke and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Lord by thinking, that our wants can renew, faſter then his ſupplies: or that our innumerable evills, ſhall not find innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good things to ballance or remove them, from the hand of God. We weary men, when we come often to them, to doe great things for us, yea to come often for ſmall matters, will weary men. But we never weary the Lord by comming often, we weary God, only, when we will not come often. How doth the Prophet, not only complaine, but expoſtulate, becauſe that unbelieving King <hi>wearied God</hi> (take it with reverence) <hi>by not ſetting him aworke,</hi> and that about the hardeſt and moſt knotty peece of work, that can be, the working of a miracle, and that as hard a one as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would aske, either <hi>in the depth beneath; or in the height above. Is it a ſmall thing with you to weary men, but will ye weary my God alſo, Iſa.</hi> 7. 13. It is no wearineſſe to God to doe innumerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles for us, but he is weary when we will not believe he can doe them. <hi>To be diſtruſted the doing of one, is more laborious to God, then to doe a million of Miracles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this, take heed above all, that you limit not God in works of ſpirituall mercy; As, to feare, to aske pardon of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have asked it often. His great works of forgiveneſſe are as much without number, as any of his works, <hi>He multiplies to pardon,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 7. And when the people of Iſrael had committed a new ſin, it is admirable to reade, by what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Moſes</hi> moves the Lord for pardon. It is not this (as uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with men) Lord this is the firſt fault, Lord thou haſt not been often troubled to ſigne their pardon: But <hi>pardon I beſeech thee,</hi>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:40455:135"/> 
                     <hi>the iniquity of this people, as thou haſt forgiven this people from Egypt untill now, Numb.</hi> 14. 19. as if he had ſaid, Lord, becauſe thou haſt pardoned them ſo often, therefore I beſeech thee pardon them now. It is a moſt wicked argument to move our hearts to ſin, becauſe God will pardon often; but when we have ſinned, it is a holy argument to move God to pardon againe, becauſe he hath pardoned often before: For he pardons without number.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing God doth innumerable great things for us, let not us be ſatisfied in doing a few things at the command, and for the glory of God: Let us continue in acts of holineſſe, charity, humility, zeale and thankfulneſſe, without number: Let us never ſtand reckoning our duties, when we heare the mercies of God are beyond reckoning. It is a noble rule in our friendſhip with men, <hi>That curteſies muſt not be counted:</hi> I am ſure it is a holy rule in our obedience to God, <hi>That duties muſt not be counted: God, hath no need of any one of our good works, but he will not beare it if we think we have done enow, or can doe too many.</hi> Let out <note place="margin">Amicitia non eſt reducenda ad ealculos. Obediantia non eſt reducenda ad calculos.</note> hearts be like the heart of God as he doth great things for us, let us doe (in what we are able) great things for God and good things for one another, without number.</p>
                  <p>So much in generall of the proofe of Gods power, by the <hi>Greatneſſe &amp;c.</hi> of his works.</p>

                  <p>There is not any difficulty about the meaning of theſe words which calls for ſtay in opening of them. Therefore in briefe, The Hebrew word for <hi>Raine,</hi> in out letters <hi>(Matar)</hi> is ſo neere in ſound to our engliſh, water, that ſome think it a deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative from it.</p>
                  <p>By the Rain, we are to underſtand, not the ſhowres only which fall from Heaven, but all thoſe bleſſings and benefits for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our naurall life, which are the fruits of raine: <hi>He ſendeth raine</hi> (as it were) on his errand, to bring or carry the bleſſings of plenty, and to drop fatnes on the earth. He giveth rain to the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40455:136"/> earth, and then the earth giveth her encreaſe. The Rabbins have a ſaying, that <hi>raine is the husband of the earth,</hi> becauſe thoſe ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers foecundate the earth, and make that <hi>great mother</hi> of plenty, <note place="margin">Imber maritus terrae.</note> fruitfull, in bringing forth all things uſefull and comfortable for the life of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He giveth raine upon the face of the earth,</hi> (ſo the letter of the Originall) that is upon the earth; as the <hi>face of Heaven, and the face of the ſea,</hi> ſo the face of the earth, is an Hebraiſme, for the earth it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>It is ſayed in the latter clauſe of the verſe, that <hi>he ſendeth waters upon the fields;</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh theſe waters from the raine, taking them for rivers and ſtreams of water, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>He cauſeth the rivers to runne among the hils;</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Habaccuk, Thou cleaveſt the earth with the rivers.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore though raine be a common bleſſing in reſpect of all places and perſons; yet we ought to acknowledge a ſpeciall hand in giving it. And this checks that naturall Atheiſme, which reigns in their hearts, who thinke that they are beholding only to the motion of the winds, or change of the Moon for rain: and hence in times of drought they looke moſt, when the wind will turne, or when the Moone will change. To confute this, the Prophet tels us by the way of queſtion, That as Idols cannot, ſo neither can the Heavens give raine, Jer. 14. 22. <hi>Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cauſe raine? Or can the Heavens give ſhowres?</hi> They cannot. Indeed the holy Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> ſpeakes ſuch language, as if he had carried the keyes of the clouds at his girdle, or had been maſter of the raine, 1 King. 17. 1. <hi>As the Lord liveth, there ſhall not be dew nor raine theſe yeares, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my word.</hi> But the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſhews us what word this was, namely a word of prayer, not of command, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 17. Elias <hi>prayed and it rained not; againe he prayed and it rained,</hi> All the power of man cannot prevaile with the heavens to raine. but the prayer of faith can prevaile with the God of heaven, <hi>To ſend raine was the worke of God, though it were at the word of a man.</hi> They who denie God in one worke will quickly denie him in another. And if we deny him in leſſer, yea the leaſt of his works, in a drop of raine, we are in danger to deny him in the greater. <hi>And they who denie God in his working, have but an eaſie ſtep, to the deniall of his being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſhould teach us to walke in dependance upon God for all naturall comforts. <hi>He giveth raine.</hi> All creatures drinke from Heaven, that they may have their eyes and their hearts in Heaven. And if we muſt walk in dependance upon God for naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, how much more for ſpirituall; if for the rain of the clouds, how much more for the dews of his Spirit, and the rain of grace upon our hearts? Further obſerve, <hi>It is a great, wonderfull and unſearchable worke of God to ſend raine:</hi> For we muſt put the ſtampe of thoſe foure characters upon all theſe workes, And ſo raine, is a great a wonderfull, and an unſearchable worke of God: ſo great and wonderfull that (as hath bin proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) no creature can commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with God, or ſhare in the honour of this worke.

                  <p>Firſt, There is marvellous power ſeen, in cauſing and giving raine. Is it not marvellous power, which raiſes the vapours and holds (as we may ſo ſpeake) <hi>A ſea of water above the earth?</hi> That ſuch mighty ſeas and floods of water hang in the ayre, and thence are diſtill'd and ſprinkled downe (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes) in ſmall drops, are acts and arguments of the wonderfull power of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Behold in the raine the wonderfull goodnes of God: who by this meanes cooles and refreſhes, nouriſhes, and ſuckles all earthly living creatures. When the ground is enapt and gapes, as it were with open mouth, the Lord opens theſe bottles and gives it drinke. And a miracle of goodnes is ſeene in this forasmuch as when his very enemyes hunger, he thus feeds them, when they are naked he thus cloaths them, when they thirſt, he thus gives them drinke. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. <hi>He ſendeth raine upon the juſt and upon the unjuſt:</hi> They are maintained in life by the goodneſſe of God, whoſe lives maintaine a continuall warr againſt his juſtice.</p>
                  <p>And as there is a wonder of goodneſſe in giving rain for the uſe of evill men: So there is a wonder of bounty in ſending raine upon thoſe places, which are not of uſe to any man; <hi>he ſendeth waters upon the fields,</hi> that is, all over the world. Hence when <hi>Elihu</hi> would ſet forth the marvellous power and bounty of God, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifies it in this <hi>(Job</hi> 38. 25.) <hi>Who hath devided a water courſe for the overſtowing of waters, to cauſe it to raine on the earth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no man is, and on the wildernes, where there is no man?</hi> Such an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and bountifull houſe doth the Lord of Heaven and earth keep, that rather then any ſhall want, he will (in a ſence) let the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runne waſt, God will not have ſo much as an herbe or a plant to want: though there be no man to come there, yet the graſſe and ſhrubs ſhall have drinke, and taſt of his bounty.</p>
                  <p>And ſo legible is that goodnes of God, which is written with drops of rain, ſo wonderfull his power and bounty in giving rain, that the Prophet wonders, at the ſtupidity of thoſe men, who are
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40455:138"/> not convinced of and taught obedience by it. <hi>They have not ſaid, let us fear the Lord that giveth the firſt and the latter raine in his ſeaſon, (Jer.</hi> 5. 24.) As if he ſhould ſay, what a ſtrange thing is it that ſweet ſhowers of raine have not ſoftened the hearts of men, into the feare of God, and made them bloſſome with and bring forth abundantly the fruits of holines? Hereupon it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable, how <hi>Moſes</hi> makes this a motive to perſwade the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael to obedience in Canaan, becauſe that country ſtood in much need of raine, which <hi>Egypt,</hi> from whence they came, did not, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. Therefore ſhall ye keepe all the Commandements, which I command you this day, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>For the land whither thou goeſt in to poſſeſſe it, is not like the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou ſoweſt thy ſeed, and wateredſt it with thy foot, like a garden of herbes.</hi> That is Egypt being a flat plaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, all upon a levell, when the Land wanted moyſture, thou didſt not ſtay for or depend upon the raine, to moiſten it, but with thy foot, thou diggedſt draines and madeſt ſluces or water-courſes, from the river ſide (meaning <hi>Nilus</hi> that famous river, which ran quite through <hi>Egypt)</hi> and that refreſhed thy lands and made them fruitfull. <hi>But (Canaan</hi> is another kind of Country, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12.) <hi>the Land whether thou goeſt in to poſſeſſe it, is a Land of hils and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, and drinketh water of the raine of Heaven. A land which the Lord thy God careth for, his eyes, are upon it,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Canaan</hi> is not a country capable of being water'd by the foot, it is ſo mountanous and uneven. All the labour of hand or foot, cannot bring the ſtreams upwards, to give thy thirſtie land drinke, it muſt drinke from heaven, or be burnt up and parcht with thirſt, and if ſo, then, that muſt be the Lords care, his eye muſt obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when tbou wanteſt raine, his hand muſt make water-courſes in the heavens, and open the ſluces and cataracts of the clouds for thee. <hi>And wilt thou not ſerve this God in duty, who in bounty thus ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee,</hi> and gives thee ſuch a ſenſible evidence of his care over thee? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preaches this to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Theologie,</hi> to leave them inexcuſable, <hi>Though he ſuffered all Nations to walke in their owne wayes</hi> (in that he gave them not either the light or reſtraint of grace, yet he did give them light and reſtraint too in nature) <hi>Nevertheleſſe he left not himſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſſe, in that he did good, and gave us raine from heaven.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 14. 17.</note> As if he had ſaid, though yee have not had the raine of the word, yet the raine of the cloud, if ſuch a Preacher of Gods power and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40455:138"/> goodneſſe, as will leave you for ever without excuſe. The Lord himſelfe ſeemes to glory in this, as one of the chiefeſt of his works: (Job 38. 37.) <hi>Who can number the clouds in wiſdome? Or who can ſtay the bottles of heaven?</hi> I challenge all creatures to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with me in this. And again in this book <hi>(Ch.</hi> 36. 26.) <hi>Elihu</hi> lifts up the greatneſſe of God in this act of his providence, <hi>Behold God is great, and we know him not;</hi> (wherein doth he inſtance his greatneſſe?) it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>For he maketh ſmall the drops of water, they powre downe raine according to the vapour thereof.</hi> Reade paralell texts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 10, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 8. So much of this firſt worke of God, the <hi>raine;</hi> and of his power, wiſdome, goodnes, bounty viſible and apparent in it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond inſtance of Gods power and wiſdome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill things, both in ſetting up and pulling downe: Firſt, in raiſing and ſetting up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To ſet up on high thoſe that be low, that thoſe which mourne may be exalted to ſafetie.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay will you ſee another way, wherein God ſhews himſelf in his power, wiſdome and goodneſſe? It is in looking thorough the world, for ſuch as are low that he may lift them up: in eſpying out mourners and weeping eyes, that he may wipe them, and more; <hi>exalt them to ſafety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of the Jewiſh Writers connect this verſe with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; making this as an effect of Gods bounty &amp; wonderfull worke in ſending raine. He ſendeth raine and ſhowers upon the earth with ſuch plenty of bleſſings, that by this means, many who were poore, low, meane and ſad-hearted, may be ſet in high eſtate, and exalted unto ſafety. And there is a truth in it, Gods bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth hath exalted many, that were low, to an high eſtate, to riches and proſperity.</p>
                  <p>But rather, we ſhall take it in a more generall ſence; And ſo <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaz</hi> in theſe words ſeemes to comfort <hi>Job</hi> by giving him a hint, that though his eſtate was now very low, yet if he would apply himſelfe unto God, as he had adviſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>By ſeeking unto and committing his cauſe to him,</hi> as low as he was, he might be <hi>ſet high againe;</hi> and though he was now a mourner, ſitting in duſt and aſhes, <hi>He might be exalted to joy and ſafetie;</hi> for in this the power, wiſdome and goodneſſe of God are uſually put forth and exalted.</p>
                  <p>The words carry an alluſion to that cuſtome of Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who ſit in high places, upon erected thrones. As (1K. 16.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40455:139"/> 19.) it is ſaid of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he built him a magnificent throne or chaire of ſtate, which had an aſſent of ſix ſteps to it, <hi>he ſate on high.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (Chap. 6. ver. 1.) deſcribes the Lord in the ſame manner, ſitting in ſtate, <hi>I ſaw the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon a throne, high and lifted up.</hi> The pride and arrogancy of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> is thus expreſt <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 14. 13.) <hi>He hath ſaid in his heart, I will exalt my throne above the ſtars, I will ſit alſo upon the Mount of the Congregation.</hi> So that to <hi>ſit on high,</hi> is as much as to be preferred or advanced, whether we reſpect honour or riches, dignity or authority.</p>
                  <q>To ſet on high thoſe that be low.</q>
                  <p>The word may note either thoſe, that are low in their own eyes, or thoſe that are made low by others, active or paſſive lowneſſe. Grace in our own hearts cauſes the former lowneſſe, and ſinfull oppreſſion from the hand of others, cauſes the latter. The former are humble, the latter are humbled; The Lord ſets both theſe on high.

                  <p> Secondly, obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They that are low and mourning, are neareſt to exaltation and ſafety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be very low, it is to be (as it were) in a due poſture and readineſſe to be exalted very high; <hi>He ſetteth the low on high</hi> (Luk. 1. 51.) <hi>He hath put downe the mighty from their ſeate, and hath exalted the humble and meeke;</hi> or, hath exalted the lowly and the meeke. We are not to underſtand it onely of thoſe, who are low, that is, lowly in minde (that frame of heart which is wrought above in the higheſt heavens (is in this ſenſe) loweſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth) but we may underſtand it likewiſe of thoſe, who are low in their eſtates; (many that are low in mind, may be high in place; a man may have aboundance of humility in the height of outward eminency) Therefore (I ſay) we muſt take in both; <hi>Before honour goes humility, as a high mind before a fall,</hi> Prov. 15. 33. And <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 113. 6, 7.) <hi>He raiſeth up the poore out of the duſt, and liſteth the needy out of the dunghill, that he may ſet him with Princes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as it is in reference to particular perſons, ſo to the Church and people of God in generall; when they are low, then look for their raiſing up. The Scripture is frequent in this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 36. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 13. And in that notable place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 9, 10. <hi>The Ambaſſadours of peace weepe bitterly, the earth mourneth, and Lebanon languiſheth, and Carmel ſhakes off her fruit, &amp;c.</hi> All places, every creature is brought in, mourning with that mourning people. When it was thus with them, <hi>Now will I ariſe,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>now will I be exalted, now will I lift up my ſelfe.</hi> There are three <hi>Nowes</hi> for it, to note <hi>That</hi> the ſpeciall <hi>Now</hi> of their exaltation. But the text ſaith, God would then be exalted. Was he brought low? God is alwayes alike exalted in himſelfe, but he is not alwayes alike exalted in his people; therefore when he ſaith, <hi>now will I be exalted,</hi> the meaning is, I will exalt this people who are low, that my name may be exalted and lifted up in the ſight of all people.</p>
                  <p>Therefore our low eſtate ſhould be ſo farre from ſinking, that it ſhould lift up our faith in beleeving deliverance and exaltation. A low eſtate, is a great advantage for faith; faith hath ſureſt footing when we lye proſtrate upon the ground: There faith ſtands firmeſt, becauſe there faith meets with moſt promiſes; Promiſes are the foundation of faith. <hi>The people of God have never ſo much of the</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:40455:140"/> 
                     <hi>word about them, as when they have leaſt of the world about them.</hi> The covenant ſits cloſeſt to us, when we are diveſted of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. When the river is at the loweſt ebbe, we are ſure the tide is comming in: The night is darkeſt a little before day breakes: When the dayes are ſhorteſt, and the winter ſharpeſt, then the ſpring of mercy is at hand. As the higheſt flouriſh of ungodly ones, is the immediate forerunner of their downfall <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 92. 7.) <hi>When the wicked ſpring as the graſſe,</hi> what then? would you know the meaning of it? The next words are a comment upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: <hi>It is, that they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever;</hi> So, the loweſt down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of the godly, is uſually the immediate forerunner of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. <hi>When the godly wither as the graſſe,</hi> the interpretation of it is, <hi>That they ſhall flouriſh for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve in the third place, from that word, <hi>exalted to ſafety</hi> That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God can ſet his people on high, beyond the reach of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> Beyond the reach of their heads or counſels, and beyond the reach of their hands and ſwords; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 16. <hi>The munitions of rockes ſhall be their place of defence:</hi> He ſetteth them on high, that no ladders can be found long enough to ſcale theſe rocks, nor any Artillery or engine, ſtrong enough to batter them downe; And leaſt any ſhould ſay, but we will hold the ſiege, till we ſtarve them out; it followes in the text <hi>Bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure.</hi> I remember a ſtory in <hi>Alexanders</hi> warres, that when he came to beſiege the <hi>Sogdians,</hi> a people who dwelt upon a rock, or had the literall munition of rocks for their defence, they jeered him, and asked him whether his Souldiers had wings or no? Unleſſe your Souldiers can fly in the ayre, we feare you not. It is a moſt certaine truth, when God exalts a people, he can ſet them upon a rock, ſo high, that unleſſe their adverſaries have wings, and thoſe more then Eagles wings, to ſoare higher then God himſelfe, they are beyond annoyance. He carries his owne upon Eagles wings, what wings then muſt they have, who get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his people?</p>
                  <p>There are theſe two things, about which the thoughts of men are moſt converſant. The one is, to be ſet on high; the other is, to be ſet in ſafety. They both meet in the mercy here promiſed; <hi>He ſetteth on high thoſe that are low,</hi> that's their honour; <hi>He exalts them to ſafety,</hi> that's their comfort. The firſt thoughts of men are ſpent to get a great eſtate, but their next thoughts are to keep
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40455:141"/> and protect it. Experience hath often ſhewed us the men of the world, rolling riches and Titles together into a mountaine, but it hath been a mountain of ſnow, one hot day hath melted all down. The mountain of outward bleſſings, upon which God raiſeth his people, ſhall be (if he pleaſes) like a mountain of Adamant, which cannot be melted, or like mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which cannot be removed. A high place is ſeldome a ſafe place: <hi>All high things are tottering,</hi>

                     <hi>and the more high, the more tottering.</hi> Then how unſearchable is the wiſdome, how great the power of God, who can ſet his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very high, and yet very ſafe? who can make a man ſtand as firme and ſteady upon the higheſt pinnacle of honour, as upon a levell ground, or in a valley of the loweſt eſtate and condition. <hi>He exalts to ſafety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence wee may draw downe a difference between Gods exaltation of his own people, and the exaltation of his enemies and wicked ones. Wicked men are oft times exalted, and God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts them, though they know it not: but how? He exalts them to a high place, but doth exalt them to a ſafe place? No, the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, after a long temptation, concludes, <hi>Thou haſt ſet them in ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery places, thou caſteſt them downe into deſtruction; how are they brought into deſolation, as in a mement,</hi> Pſal. 73. 18, 19. <hi>Haman</hi> was exalted high, but not in ſafety: Many are exalted, as <hi>Jezabel</hi> exalted <hi>Naboth,</hi> high among the people; but it was to ſtone him, rather then to honour him. It is ſaid of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he lifted up the head of his chiefe <hi>Baker,</hi> he lifted up his head out of priſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but he lifted up his head to the gallowes alſo; he lifted him out of priſon, but it was unto his death. Such is the lifting up of wicked men, they may be ſet on high, but they are never ſet in ſafety. How many have we ſeen ſuddenly advanced, and as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly depreſs'd? <hi>We are never ſafe, but where God ſets us, or while God holds us in his hand.</hi> Fourthly obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a wonder, a wonderfull work of God, to exalt thoſe that are low, and ſet mourners in ſafety.</hi> The 107 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> is a Pſalme, recounting the wonderfull works of God; <hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord for his wonderfull works!</hi> is the burthen of that holy ſong. And all thoſe wonders conclude in this, <hi>ver.</hi> 39. 40. <hi>Againe, they are miniſhed and brought low, through oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, affliction, and ſorrow:</hi> what then? <hi>He powreth contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Princes, &amp;c. yet ſetteth he the poore on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</hi> How wonderfull is this,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40455:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> that the Lord will give Kings for the ranſome of his people, and to raiſe his poore, will powre contempt upon Princes? The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt muſt downe, rather then his low ones ſhall not be ſet on high. There are foure things, which encreaſe this wonder, and make it exceeding wonderfull. Firſt, Theſe poore have no ſtrength, <hi>(Deut.</hi> 32. 36.) <hi>He ſees that their ſtrength is gone.</hi> Secondly, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they have no hope, no faith, <hi>When the Son of Man comes, ſhall he finde</hi> (among low ones) <hi>faith</hi> (this faith to be exalted) <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth,</hi> Luk. 18. 8. Thirdly, They have many enemies, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till enemies, powerfull enemies, confident enemies, enemies (above hope) arrived at aſſurance, that they ſhall keep poore ones at an under for ever. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) how many are they that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me?</hi> So many they were, that he could not tell how many. Fourthly, They are ſuppoſed to have no friends, none to appeare for them. <hi>Let us perſecute and take him</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for there is</hi>

Thus it is with the Church and ſervants of God, when they are low, all the world is upon their backs; the world of wicked ones hang about them, one with his power, another with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, all with their utmoſt endeavours to hold them downe; yet the Lord ſets them on high, who were thus low, and exalts them to ſafety, who were thus in danger. <hi>Oh that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, and declare his wonderfull workes to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is further cleared in the 12th verſe, <hi>He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hand cannot performe their enterpriſe.</hi> As if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſhould ſay, would you know, how God exalteth his people, and ſetteth them in ſafety? 'Tis true, they have many enemies many that plot and deviſe evill againſt them, but the Lord breakes their plots, he out-plots them; <hi>He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, &amp;c.</hi> And as this is a proof of the former, ſo it is a further inſtance of Gods wonderfull works.

                     <hi>Satan makes uſe of ſubtle, crafty men, and abuſeth their parts for his own purpoſes. He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty.</hi> God never diſappointeth thoſe, whom he ſets aworke: If God diſappoints the devices of men, theſe devices were not of God; Satan ſets thoſe aworke, whoſe work God ſpoiles. The Lord loves to breake Satans engines, tooles and inſtruments. Chriſt came to deſtroy the works of the Devill, both his works within us, and his workes againſt us. All Satans works and workmen ſhall rue it, when Chriſt pleaſes. And here we ſee whom Satan ſets aworke, even men of the fineſt wits, of the moſt reaching braines, of the decepeſt judgements and richeſt endowments: theſe he draweth in to his pay, and makes ſerviceable for his ends; that's Satans deſigne; ſuch as are amongſt men, as the ſerpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the beaſts, the moſt ſubtill of all, theſe Satan makes uſe of: The deepe policie of an <hi>Achitophel,</hi> the <hi>Great Oracle</hi> of his times for counſell, he deſires to improve againſt a <hi>David;</hi> The high parts and learning of a <hi>Julian,</hi> he deſires to improve and boyle up againſt the Chriſtians; ſuch a one will not only <hi>Fire and ſword, but ſet hard to jeere and wit them out of the profeſſion of the Goſpell.</hi>

                     <hi>Patriarkes of Heretickes,</hi> or <hi>The Patrons of Hereſies;</hi> They were men of high conceits and apprehenſions, and in thoſe fertile and rich grounds, Satan with great ſucceſſe caſt the tares of errour. When Chriſt came into the world, he had moſt oppoſition among the craftie <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> And <hi>Herod</hi> the Fox (as Chriſt himſelfe calls him for his ſubtilty) was a notorious inſtrument of Satan, to hinder the receiving of Chriſt. Our Lord Chriſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times chuſeth the ſimpleſt the meaneſt the plaineſt men, fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to do his worke. But Satan chuſeth the ſubtileſt he can find <hi>in learned Throngs,</hi> to ſend of his errand. The reaſon of this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betweene Chriſts choiſe and Satans, is; <hi>Satan cannot make a Mercury out ef every block,</hi> he is not able to give a man underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, wiſedome or abilities for his worke: neither can he increaſe or improve any mans parts and gifts: he muſt have inſtruments ready to his hand, he can but put them forward and tempt them on. He will give ſuch as are ſtrong and craftie, many motives to ſerve him, but he cannot furniſh them with ſtrength or craft to ſerve him. But Chriſt can give gifts to men, which they have not, and raiſe the parts, which they have. <hi>He can make himſelf a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, a meſſenger out of any blocke. Chriſt can ſend a foole of his errand, and cauſe him to doe it wiſely;</hi> He can cauſe the ſtamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tongue to ſpeake plaine, and the plaineſt man to ſpeake the higheſt Rhetorick. When a <hi>Moſes</hi> complaines of a <hi>ſlow tongue,</hi> he can ſay, <hi>I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou ſhalt ſay,</hi> Exod. 4. 12. If he finds us not fit to doe his buſineſſe, he can make us fit. If Chriſt pleaſe, he can make a man maſter of his trade, before, or as ſoone as ever he is a ſervant to it. Thus, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wiſdome of the world, Chriſt overcomes the wiſdome of the world; And <hi>by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching</hi> (as men count fooliſhneſſe) <hi>ſaveth thoſe that beleeve</hi> (1 Cor. 1. 21.) <hi>the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is wiſer then man,</hi> That is, thoſe inſtruments which Chriſt impioyes, how fooliſh ſoever men account them, ſhall foile all the wiſdome of man.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let no man boaſt of his natural <hi>parts,</hi> unles they be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riualiz'd, and reſign'd up (for ſuch Chriſt commonly uſes, though he can make uſe of others) to the ſervice of Chriſt. Conſider to whom you are inſtrumentall, with your parts and knowledge. All
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40455:145"/> wit out of Chriſts work, degenerates into craft, and wiſdome into wickedneſſe. It is Satans worke to ſollicite the learning of men (even as an Adulterer ſollicites the beauty of women) that he may commit folly with it, and beget ſome monſtruous birth of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and villanie.</p>
                  <p>For, when ſuch appeare on Satans ſide, they are a great credit to his cauſe, and by the reputation of their learning and parts draw others to it.

As the Lord ſuffers his own people to feare much, that when deliverance comes, their joy may be full: ſo, he ſuffers wicked men to hope much, that their ſorrows may be full, when they cannot be delivered. A woman forgets the pains of her travell, for joy that a man childe is borne into the world; And theſe men ſhall remember the paines of their travell, for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that a monſter (ſuch are their deſignes) is not borne into the world. <hi>That their miſchiefe comes not (in their ſenſe) to light, leaves them in deſperate darkneſſe.</hi> Fourthly obſerve,</p>

We ſhould in this imitate our enemies, not to ſtand deviſing and conſulting, this is a good way, and t'others a good way, and then doe neither; or then ſit ſtill and moulder away in expectation; love to, and zeale for Chriſt, and his truth, ſhould render us as full of action, as of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, of execution as of deſigne.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, though they did attempt it with their hands, yet they could not effect it with their hands, <hi>Their hands did not performe their enterpriſe.</hi> Hence note, That</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Phariſees</hi> after all their confederacies againſt Chriſt were forc't (without any racke, but that of their owne conſciences) to make this confeſſion, Joh. 12. 19. <hi>Perceive ye how we prevail nothing.</hi> At this day, they have many fine devices and <hi>Idaeas</hi> ready framed in their heads, but the hand ſhakes, <hi>They cannot performe their enterpriſe.</hi> They want not counſell, nor craft, nor skill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor will, nor deſires, nor endeavours, only they want God with them.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40455:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> Hence it is, that though they gather very proper materials, and lay very ſtrong foundations, yet they cannot reare up their building. And in the iſſue (Luk. 14. 29.) <hi>All that behold it ſhall mock, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Theſe men began to build, and were not able to finiſh;</hi> It is the maine worke of God to ſtop evill men in their workes: what they would doe, he ſaith they ſhall not, and what they would not doe he ſaith they ſhall. <hi>Pharoah</hi> deviſed a deviſe againſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but his hands could not performe his enterpriſe, <hi>Haman</hi> deviſed a deviſe againſt the Jewes, but his hands could not performe his enterpriſe. <hi>Achitophel</hi> gave craftie counſell againſt <hi>David,</hi> but his hands could not performe his enterpriſe. <hi>Herod</hi> the Fox plotted againſt Chriſt, to hinder the courſe of his <hi>Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>Mediatourſhip,</hi> but he could not performe his enterpriſe; 'Tis ſo all along<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 2. 1.) it is ſaid, <hi>Why doe the Heathen imagine a vaine thing;</hi> a vaine thing, becauſe a thing ſucceſſeleſſe, their hands could not performe it, It was vaine, not only, becauſe there was not true ground of reaſon, why they ſhould imagine or doe ſuch a thing, but vaine alſo, becauſe they labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in vaine, they could not doe it. And therefore it followes, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>He that ſitteth in the heavens ſhall laugh, the Lord hath them in deriſion.</hi> The Lord ſees what fooles they are, and men (yea themſelves) ſhall ſee it. The Prophet gives us an elegant deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this purpoſe (Iſa. 59. 9.) <hi>They weave the spiders web, but their webs ſhall not become garments, neither ſhall they cover themſelves with their workes.</hi> As if he had ſaid, they have beene deviſing and ſetting things in a goodly frame to catch flies, they have been ſpinning a fine thread, out of their braines, as the Spider doth out of her bowels, ſuch is their web; but when they have this web, They cannot cut it out, or make it up into a garment. They ſhall go naked and cold, notwithſtanding all their ſpinning and weaving, all their plotting and deviſing. <hi>The next broome that comes will ſweepe away all their webs, and the Spiders too, except they creepe apace.

                  <p>How many viſible demonſtrations have we of this in our times! How many cunning, but ruining devices, lie by the wals at this day unacted! They went through the <hi>Head-worke,</hi> but they could not get through <hi>their Hand-worke.</hi> We may ſay as in the Pſalme (76. 5.) <hi>None of the men of might have found their hands:</hi> The men of craft ſound their heads, but the men of might (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40455:146"/> be God) have not yet found their hands, to execute up to the height of the diviſers, either, wit or malice.</p>
                  <p>In this we ſee the glorious prerogative of God. How many thouſand, thouſand, thouſand thoughts do men looſe. The thoughts of many yeares are loſt in a moment. <hi>God never loſt, nor never ſhall looſe one thought.</hi> And therefore <hi>David</hi> puts theſe two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a breath. Having ſaid (Pſal. 33. 10) <hi>The Lord bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the counſell of the Heathen to nought, he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</hi> In the next verſe, he ſubjoynes, <hi>The counſell of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all Generations.</hi> And as the counſel of the Lord ſtands ſo he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the counſell of thoſe to ſtand, who conſult for him. <hi>He confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the word of his ſervants, and performeth the counſell of his Meſſengers,</hi> Iſa. 44. 26. So that their hands ſhall performe their enterpriſe, as the Lord encourageth the ancient people (Zac. 4. 9) <hi>The hands of</hi> Zerubbabel <hi>have laid the foundation of this houſe, his hands ſhall alſo finiſh it:</hi> And againe, Chap. 8. 13. <hi>Fear not, let your hands be ſtrong.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Feare not, goe on with your worke; For your hands ſhall performe their enterpriſe,</hi> you ſhall not beaten from your worke, neither ſhall ye work in vain. <hi>The Lord himſelfe hath no barren counſels, and he makes all the counſels which are for him, bring forth in their due time, deſired fruit, the longed for and beloved iſſue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, obſerve; That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a great and wonderfull worke of God, to diſappoint the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſtop the enterpriſes of crafty men,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> puts this among the wonders of God. This is reported in a way of admiration concerning God (Iſa. 44. 25.) <hi>He fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad, he turneth wiſe men backwards, and maketh their knowledge fooliſh.</hi> The wiſdome of God is moſt ſeen, in defeating the wiſe, as the power of God is moſt ſeene, in overthrowing the ſtrong. While we conſider that <hi>Theirs</hi> are ſecret devices, and that they are ſubtill devices, that they have many devices, and that they have many wayes to bring theſe devices to paſſe, it cannot fall below a wonder in our thoughts, that their thoughts, or devices are not accompliſhed. Therefore the Pſalmiſt concludes <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 124.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe it had bin the Lord, who was on our ſide, &amp;c. we had bin ſwallowed up quick and taken in their ſnare.</hi> As if he had ſaid, if we ſhould have had any leſſe then God, to helpe us, we had been gone, all the world
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40455:147"/> could not ſave us. To paſſe through a place full of gins and ſnares and pits ſet and made on purpoſe, to take a man, and that man not taken, is marvellous in our eyes. Thus it is with the people of God, they walk among ſnares and traps; <hi>The trade of moſt wicked men, is to be Trap-makers, Snare makers, if not Sword makers againſt the Saints of the moſt high.</hi> They meet with devices upon devices, and plots upon plots; now, that God ſhall diſappoint all theſe, and exalt his people to ſafety in the very face of death and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, how admirable!</p>
                  <p>But ſome may object; Yet we ſee that, at leaſt ſome of theſe plots are not diſappointed, at leaſt ſome of theſe devices take, and we have ſeen bloudy hands performing their enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, in a word; Firſt, this text and the obſervation bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd upon it, are to be underſtoood of what is often done, not ſtrictly of what is alwaies done. The Lord very frequently <hi>diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the devices of the crafty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, their very ſucceſſe is a diſappointment, and their proſperity is their curſe. For their cauſe is under a curſe, and ſo are their perſons, when both ſeeme moſt ſuccesfull. If outward judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſlay not wicked men, <hi>Their prosperitie ſhall,</hi> Pro. 1. 32.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all the ſucceſſe, which the devices of wicked craftie ones have, tends to the fulfilling of Gods counſels, more then their own: So that, though it be to the eye, or in the letter, ſucceſs to them, yet in truth, and upon the matter, it is ſucceſs to the cauſe of God, Craft prevailes no further, &amp; no longer on earth, then ſerves to accompliſh the counſels of heaven, and fulfill what infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath deviſed. Therefore when you ſee any devices of the craftie thrive, know, that God is ſerving himſelfe upon them, and that they are but acting, <hi>What his hand and counſell hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before to be done,</hi> Act. 4 28. As Chriſt himſelfe overcame by dying, ſo doe they who are Chriſts, they have ſucceſſe in all their diſappointments; and theſe are diſappointed in all their ſucceſſes, and die while they overcome. No ſinfull device of man ever did, or ever ſhall prevaile, beyond a contribution to the juſt and holy purpoſe of God. All their prevailings are diſappointments, who intentionally oppoſe, though they really accompliſh the good pleaſure and purpoſe of God.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, The word is applied in Scripture, to a taking, or a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery by a lot; So <hi>(Joſh.</hi> 7. 15.) The rule was thus given, <hi>He that ſhall be taken with the accurſed thing ſhall be burnt;</hi> and verſ. 18. <hi>Achan was taken,</hi> that is, taken by a lot, the lot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and catcht him. <hi>Achan</hi> had hid the Babyloniſh garment, and the wedge of gold ſafe enough, as he thought: and one would have thought, that in ſuch a multitude, in ſuch an huge hoſt and throng of people, he might have been hidden too; but God ſends a lot, and takes out <hi>Achan</hi> from the middeſt of all the multitude, he calls him out by name, this is the man. There may be a like meaning and uſe of the word in this place, <hi>He taketh the wiſe in their own craftines,</hi> that is, men who think to ſhelter themſelves amongſt the multitude, or to walke in the clouds of craft; men who hide and ſhadow themſelves from the eye of the world, as if none ſhould ſee who they are, or what they doe; even theſe God will take, he will direct a <hi>divine lot.</hi> one time or other to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and lay hold on them; he will diſcover <hi>Achans, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of his Iſrael</hi> in their wicked counſels; and bring to light their <hi>ſtoln wedges of gold, and their Babyloniſh garments.</hi>

Not, that there is any, the leaſt imaginable fooliſhneſſe in God, for as <hi>God is light, and in him there is no darkneſſe at all, ſo God is wiſdome, and in him there is no fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all;</hi> but the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes thus, to put God as low as the fooliſheſt thoughts of man can put him, which is to think there is fooliſhneſſe in God, yet in that, or then, he is wiſer than they.

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a ſore judgement not to ſee when there is light.</hi> It is like ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at a full Table, or periſhing with thirſt, in the midſt of a fountaine. It is a great judgement not to have light to ſee by, but it is a greater judgement, not to ſee by the light. It is a great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a people, when they have not the light of the Goſpel; <hi>when Chriſt who is the light,</hi> is not ſhiningly preached among them; but if light ſhine, if Chriſt be preached, and a people ſee it not, This is a farre greater judgement. The poore Gentiles before the light of the Goſpell came to them, <hi>ſate in darknes, and in the ſhadow of death;</hi> and in that eſtate, they could only (like blind men) grope after God, as the Apoſtle elegantly expreſſes it Act. 17. 27. <hi>He hath made of one bloud all Nations of men, &amp;c. that they ſhould ſeek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him and find him.</hi> The Gentiles were inexcuſable, if they did not find the Lord by Feeling after him in the darke: What then are they, who find him not by ſeeing in the light? The Apoſtle ſhewes us them as <hi>loſt men, and blinded by Satan, to whom the light of the glorious Gospel doth not ſhine, when it ſhines</hi> (2 Cor. 4, 3, 4.) To grope in Goſpel-light, to be in darkneſſe, when truth is at her high-noon, is, as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death. It is the worſt of ſins to ſin againſt the light, and it is the worſt of judgements, not to ſee the light; by which we may avoid ſinne. The heat of divine wrath breaks out in this, when abuſed light is huniſhed with want of ſight, or when light is ſent, and eyes taken away, (Iſa. 6. 9, 10.) When the Prophet brought killing light to the Jews, he ſaith, <hi>See ye indeed; but perceive not,</hi> that is, becauſe ye have had light, and would not ſee beleevingly; Now ye ſhall have light, which ye ſhall not ſee, perceivingly, or diſtinctly: as the man in the Goſpell ſaw, but he did not perceive, when he ſaw men walking as trees, he had not a diſtinguiſhing eye, or a <hi>diſcerning ſence,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Heb. 5. 14. But why ſhall they not perceive, when they ſee? The Prophet tels us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Shut their eyes leaſt they ſee.</hi> The work of a Prophet is to open eys, but when men wilfuly ſhut their eys, then</p>

                  <p> God ſhuts them judicially, and blinds them with light. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle quoting this text, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 27, expounds it ſo, <hi>Their eyes, have they cloſed, least they ſhould ſee;</hi> for this, God cloſed them that they could not ſee. <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching, and he preached <hi>Chriſt</hi> the true <hi>light, The Sun of righteouſneſſe:</hi> Behold the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery ſpoken of in this text, <hi>They met with darknes in the day time. This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darknes rather than light.</hi> Why love they darkneſſe? Becauſe they ſee not the light: And becauſe they ſee not the light, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot love it. It is impoſſible to ſee the light, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull face of the truth, as it is revealed in Chriſt, and not to love it. A Heathen ſaid, if vertue (much more if Goſpell truth) were ſeen, every eye would be taken, and every heart led captive by it. A great part of the world hath not this light to ſee, and the greateſt part of thoſe, who have this light, ſee it not. They muſt needs meet with darkneſſe, who are darkneſſe, in the day-time. And they muſt grope at noon day, as in the night, who are night. If men heare the law and the teſtimony, and neither ſpeake nor doe according to that word, it is (as the Prophet gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) becauſe there is <hi>no light in them;</hi> or as the Hebrew, <hi>No Morning in them,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20. Till the <hi>day ſtarr ariſes in our hearts,</hi> the day before our eyes, is night.</p>

                  <p> Chriſt breaks forth into a vehement gratulation to his Father, (Mat. 11. 25.) <hi>I thanke thee O Father, Lord of heaven nnd earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes.</hi> The wiſe and prudent could not ſee, ſo much as children. They were ſo wiſe in their own conceits, that they could not conceive the things of God. As it is in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, ſo likewiſe, in regard of civill counſels. God hides wiſedome from the wiſe, and underſtanding from the prudent.

                  <p>I ſhould here more diſtinctly open theſe great evils, <hi>The Sword, The mouth, and the hand of the mighty, with the goodneſſe of God in ſaving his poore from them;</hi> But theſe particulars occurre againe, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. Where you may find a more diſtinct explication of them. From theſe words thus farre opened. Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to what all the devices and crafty counſels of ungodly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40455:156" rendition="simple:additions"/> tend. Here we have the iſſue or Engliſh of their counſels, the meaning of their State myſteries is interpreted, <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi> Their craft concludes in cruelty, and their witty devices, in drawn Swords, ſlandering tongues, or the hands of violence. We may ſay of them, as <hi>Jacob</hi> of his ſonnes <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> Gen. 49. 5, 6. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O my ſoule come not thou in their ſecret, for in their anger they will ſlay men, and in their ſelfe will digge down a wall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve their method. Firſt, here is the bloudy Sword, they will cut them off, and rid their hands of them, if they can: They could wiſh (as that bloudy <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor) that the heads of their ſmppoſed enemies (poſſibly their beſt friends) were ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſhoulder, and that they might cut them all off at one blow. But if God ſave his poore from the mouth of the Sword; then, the next weapon is the Sword of their mouths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Slanders and defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, lyes and falſe accuſations ſhall reach them, whom, iron and ſteele, pike and ſhot cannot. <hi>The tongue is a little member, but it is a world of iniquity, and beaſteth</hi> (often acteth) <hi>great things,</hi> Jam. 3. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>But if God ſaves his poore from both mouth and Sword, ſo that their enemies cannot prevaile <hi>at ſharpes.</hi> Then they try <hi>at blunts,</hi> by a heavy hand, to over-loade, oppreſſe and keepe them down, in their eſtates, liberties and priviledges.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve thirdly; That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salvation is of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The faith of <hi>David</hi> graſped this, as his richeſt treaſure, Pſal 68. 20. <hi>He that is our God, he is the God of ſalvation;</hi> The Lord is called, the God of ſalvation, as the God of comfort, both affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and negatively. Salvation is to be had in him, and there is no ſalvation to be had without him. <hi>Truly in vaine is ſalvation ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for from the hils, and from the multitude of mountains</hi> (from Armies, or from counſels; from the power and polices of men) <hi>In the Lord our God is the ſalvation of Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 3. 23.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is obſerveable againſt whom theſe crafty, cruell men muſter up and levie the united forces of ſword, tongue and hand, <hi>They are the poore. He ſaveth the poore.</hi> Why, will not God ſave the rich, will he not ſave the mighty, the Princes of the earth? Yes God will ſave all that feare him, both high and low, rich and poore. Why then is it ſaid, <hi>He ſaveth the poore?</hi> As it were, determining Salvation upon them. The reaſon is, becauſe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40455:156"/> as the poore are moſt eaſily oppreſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo uſually they are moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt: <hi>where the hedge is loweſt, men goe over faſteſt.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, for the moſt part, Gods people are poore, comparatively to others they are the vallies the lower parts of the earth; and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is commonly advanced upon the mountaines of wealth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and greatneſſe; therefore the denomination is taken from them; <hi>He ſaveth the poore. They whom God loves moſt, the world loves leaſt, and they have leaſt of the world.</hi> The world gives moſt to its own; And God hath given his own ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the world, that, the loſſe of a world, is not diſcerned in their eſtate, and worldly gaines are not often diſcerneable in their eſtates; therefore, though in Chriſt, they are <hi>heires of all things, and all is theirs,</hi> yet their ranke and titles are among the poore.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly obſerve: They are poore ones, yet what deviſing and plotting is here againſt them? Crafty counſels, drawne ſwords, envenom'd tongues, ſtrong hands lifted up: Againſt whom are all theſe? <hi>Againſt the poore:</hi> Note thence, That</p>
                  <p>

A dead dog cannot bite,</hi> or if I bite, it is but <hi>a flea-bite; A dead dog can doe no hurt, and a living flea can doe but little. The people of God (as ſuch) never have any will to doe wrong, and it is ſeldome that they have any power to doe wrong,</hi> and yet the world is all up in purſuit againſt them; What's the reaſon of it? what's the matter? The truth is, how poore and low ſoever they are, yet there is an eye of jealouſie awake upon them: The world looks upon them as <hi>a ſuspected par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> the world hath ſecret miſgivings, that one time or other, they muſt riſe upon their ruines; and therefore they will keepe them downe (yes that they will) as long as they can.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40455:157"/> gate, and the other ſtood at the Kings elbow, and had his eare, yea and his ſignet (upon the matter) at his command: yet this <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> muſt needs oppreſſe <hi>Mordecai,</hi> becauſe he would not bow: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had a jealous eye upon him, he was a ſuſpected perſon; Though he could not reach <hi>Haman</hi> yet <hi>Haman</hi> fear'd he might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine him.</p>
                  <p>Againe there is a continuall <hi>Antipathy between the two ſeeds;</hi> and <hi>Antipathy</hi> is incureable; <hi>To oppoſe the godly, is not ſo much the diſeaſe, as the nature of wicked men:</hi> And we know, <hi>antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> are againſt the whole kind, revenge againſt this, or that <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall</hi> is no <hi>eaſe</hi> to it; <hi>Antipathy</hi> is not ſpent, but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the whole kind.

He hated thoſe whom he never ſaw, thoſe who had never wrong'd him, haply had bowed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; yet, becauſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> dye they muſt.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly obſerve <hi>(But he ſaveth the poore) God delights to help the poore.

                  <p>In the former notion of hope, the ſenſe runnes thus; God having taken the wiſe in their own craftineſſe, and diſappointed the device of the crafty, having delivered the poore from the ſword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty, now the poor hath the thing he looked for, the thing he prayed for, the thing for which he hath been ſeeking and waiting upon God: <hi>So the poore hath hope,</hi> that is, he hath the mercy, he expected, <hi>ſalvation from the ſword, &amp;c.</hi> he is made <hi>partaker of his hope,</hi> by thoſe glorious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of the juſtice and mercy of God.

The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God (though priſoners) are yet priſoners of hope, that is, they have hope of deliverance and enlargement, in their greateſt ſtreights: The power of God is never impriſon'd, and while his people can make this out, their ſpirits are not.

Graces have a generation one from another, though all have but one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from Chriſt at once. We have here the genealogy of hope in three deſcents.</hi> Experience is the next, or immediate parent of hope. <hi>So the poore hath hope.</hi> Thus it is begotten. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>God who hath delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver, in him we trust, that he will yet deliver us.</hi> An armed daring <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> ſhould be looked upon as vanquiſht already, when we can but remember a vanquiſht Lion and a Beare.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>The poore hath hope:</hi> He doth not ſay, God having thus deſtroyed the ungodly, and ſaved his own people from the ſword, &amp;c. now they have liberty, now they have peace, now they have aboundance of riches and proſperity; but he makes this the iſſue, <hi>now they have hope:</hi> Whence note, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hope is a greater and better poſſeſſion unto the people of God here, than all the great and good things which they poſſeſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Put as much into their hands us you can, there is more than that put in their hearts by hope. <hi>The poore hath hope:</hi> he lookes over all his poſſeſſions, and pitcheth upon expectation as his portion. The eſtate which a beleever hath in the promiſes, is more than the eſtate he hath in poſſeſſion: Riches in the promiſe, is better than riches in the cheſt.

                  <p>Here is the oppoſite effect, <hi>iniquity;</hi> the abſtract is put for the concrete. <hi>iniquity, for men of iniquity, wicked men, theſe ſtop their mouthes.</hi> And it is obſerveable, that as before God made them active in their own deſtruction, ſo here he makes them active in their own ſilence; he ſaith not, <hi>God ſtoppeth their mouthes, but they ſtop their own mouthes;</hi> that is, the wicked ſeeing thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40455:159"/> works of God, have not a word to ſay, nor a counſell to give more againſt the godly; <hi>they are as mute as fiſhes, as dumbe as dogs,</hi> they know not how to ſlander, or of whom to complaine, and therefore they ſuſpend, and enjoyne ſilence upon themſelves.

(Mat.</hi> 22. 12.) ſo theſe works of Chriſt ſhall make his enemies <hi>ſpeechleſſe, Iniquity ſtoppeth her mouth,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>ſtopping their mouthes,</hi> is cauſed two wayes; Firſt, from ſhame; A man is ſometime ſilent, becauſe he is aſham'd to ſpeake: diſappointments (eſpecially ſuch as theirs before noted) produce ſhame naturally, and ſhame makes ſilent. <hi>A man that bluſhes much, ſpeakes little,</hi> and he that dayes not lift up his head, will not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to lift up his voice. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>I will ſhew marvellous things</hi> (ſaith the Lord, and what then?) <hi>The Nations ſhall ſee and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, they ſhall lay their hand upon their mouth, their eares ſhall be deafe: They ſhall ſee it, and be confounded,</hi> that is, they ſhall be greatly aſhamed; confuſion of face is but ſhame heightned, and the Holy Ghoſt puts ſhame and confuſion of face together in divers places. Now this great ſhame layes their hands upon their mouthes, and puts their fingers in their eares; they are reſolvedly both dumb and deafe, at the ſight of thoſe marvellous things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Admiration and amazement ſilence them:</hi> The works of God being marvellous, they ſhall ſtand admiring and wondring at them, till they cannot ſpeake. Reade the like, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 15. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 42. where, when the Prophet had reckoned up many wonderfull works of God, he concludes as in the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 42. <hi>He ſetteth the poore on high, &amp;c. the righteous ſhall ſee it and rejoyce and all iniquity ſhall ſtop her mouth;</hi> while the Lord ſeemes to doe nothing, or to doe but little, <hi>iniquity will doe nothing, but talke,</hi> or it talkes very much, it is very talkative; but if once God begin work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, iniquity has done ſpeaking, you ſhall heare no more of them, till the next ſucceſſe on their ſide. Then obſerve, Firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wicked men will never ceaſe ſlandering and cenſuring, brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and boaſting, till ſome eminent judgement ſtops their mouthes.

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40455:160"/> ſmall judgements will not open the eyes of wicked men, ſo ſmall judgments wil not ſtop their mouths, but when God begins to work wonders, they are dumb, they have done. Secondly obſerve, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God will doe ſuch things for his people, as ſhall put the crafty to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> The Saints ought to live ſo holily, <hi>that by well doing they may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15. The Lord will do ſo juſtly and gloriouſly, as ſhall put to ſilence the malice of the wiſeſt men: <hi>Theſe two, the holineſſe of the Saints, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, are ſtopples in the mouthes, or the ſtop-mouthes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men.</hi> As they by unrighteous acts have ſtopped other mens mouthes, and ſilenced them, ſo God <hi>by terrible things in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> will ſtop their mouthes, and ſilence them for ever: They ſhall have nothing to ſay at laſt, either againſt the juſtice of God, or a gainſt the innocency of his people; <hi>againſt both theſe their mouthes chiefly open.</hi> They impute and faſten unrighteouſneſſe on God: you talk of God, and boaſt of his promiſes, where is he? where are they? The Prophet brings them in, belching out ſuch blaſphemies <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 5. 19.) <hi>They ſay, let him make ſpeed and haſten his work that we may ſee it; and let the councell of the holy One of Iſrael, draw nigh and come that we may know it.</hi> Words filled with as high a ſenſe of ſpirituall wickedneſſe, as wit and malice can infuſe. They jeere the patience of God, as ſlackneſſe, and as if Juſtice it ſelfe were tired, or too ſlow pac'd, they ſpurre it on, to ruine themſelves. You have often told us of the <hi>Holy One of Iſrael, and what he would doe, but threatned men live long, we ſee.</hi> You are nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler of your tongues, then your Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is of his hands: Therefore <hi>let him make ſpeed</hi> (if he can) <hi>and haſten his work that we may ſee it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Will not the jealouſie of the Lord awake, at the noiſe of this hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh blaſphemy? will he not ſtop the mouth of this iniquity? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will: And the Prophet aſſures us he will at the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe: <hi>Therefore as the fire devoureth the ſtubble, and as the flame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the chaffe, ſo their root ſhall be rottenneſſe, and their bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes ſhall goe up as duſt.</hi> But how doth the fire devour the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? how doth the flame conſume the chaffe? even in a moment; fire needs no blowing, to make it take hold of dry ſtubble: <hi>Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is at once flame and aſhes.</hi> So ſpeedy ſhall the conſumption of theſe men be, who called the Lord to make ſpeed; Then (I believe) they'l no more bid him make haſte, The mouth of this iniquity will be ſtopt for ever. <hi>Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>

                  <q>Happy is the man whom God correcteth, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Happineſſe is the enjoyment of good commeaſurate to all our deſires.</hi> That's perfect happineſſe. Happineſſe is the ſumme of all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and the aime of all our endeavours: And when we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained perfect happineſſe, we ſhall be at a full point, both of our deſires and endeavours.</p>
                  <p>But though all men have happineſſe in their eye (to be happy is their end, and this happineſſe is but one) Yet the wayes, which men have chalked out, as leading to happineſſe, have been not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly various, but almoſt infinite. Some of the learned have reckoned up two or three Centuries, or hundreds of opinions, concerning this one point. And it is well obſerved, that men varied thus in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion about happineſſe, becauſe they thought the enjoyment of that, wherein any of them was defective, would make them happy. He that was poore, ſaid, I ſhould be happy, if I had riches, and thence grew his opinion, that happineſſe conſiſted in riches: The ſick man ſaid, I ſhould be happy, if I had my health, and thence grew his opinion, that happineſſe conſiſted in health: Another was obſcure, meane and low, <hi>O</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>how happy were I, if I were honourable,</hi> and thence grew a third opinion, that happineſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in honour; Thus they varied according to their particular neceſſities and intereſts. But amongſt all thoſe <hi>Opinioniſts;</hi> we meet not with any one, who pitcht upon this in the Text. This is a <hi>Paradox</hi> to them all, A naturall man cannot place happineſſe in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40455:161"/> correction. No Philoſopher or pure Moraliſt ever ſaid, happy is the man, that is ſore; happy is the man, that is ſicke; happy is the man that is diſgraced; or happy is the man, that is in priſon; Theſe are riddles, ſuch as nature is not able to expound or make out; the Philoſopher would as ſoon place light in darkneſſe, the Sunne in a cloud, heat in coldneſſe, the element of fire in the water, as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe in ſufferings. Therefore no marvell if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> uſher it in, with <hi>a Behold, Behold happy is the man, whom God cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, it is to increaſe the ſignification, and heighten the ſenſe; as noting the confluence of many good things in happineſſe. <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>

                     <hi>is not a ſingle good;</hi> happineſſe conſiſts in the concurrence or meeting together of many good things: God, who is infinitely happy, infinitely bleſſed in himſelfe, and an infinite bleſſing, all bleſſing to his people, is not a ſingle good, or a particular good, but he is all good, both to himſelfe, and to his people. A godly man is happy in the largeſt ſence, in all ſences; becauſe his, is not this or that particular good, but all good. And he is not happy only at this or that particular time, but at all times. He is as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, when he is ſuffering under the hand of God, as when he is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, as happy in his paſſive as in his active obedience. And therefore the ſame word expreſſes his condition, both in the one, and in the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe there is a two-fold happineſſe: Firſt, the happineſſe of this life. And ſecondly, the happineſſe of the next; Temporall happines, and eternall happines; Corporall happines and ſpirituall happines. To note a complication of all theſe, the word may be given in the Duall or Plurall number; He that is thus corrected, looſes not temporall happines, and he gains in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and toward eternall happines. The preſent and future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Saints, the happineſſe of grace and of glory, differ but in
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40455:162"/> degrees; <hi>It is the ſame ſtate in a higher ſtature: The ſame book in a more correct edition and fairer letter.</hi> Theſe differ as a child from a man, or as the morning light, from the light at high-noon; So then, this word includes all kinds and degrees of happines: yet, here it is properly to be underſtood of the happines of this life, which only is conſiſtent with correction; <hi>There are no rods in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and we ſhall be paſt children, before we come thither.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may anſwer plainly, that the word in the Hebrew <note place="margin">

                  <p>It is further obſervable concerning this word, that it is alwayes applied unto man, whereas the word <hi>(Barac)</hi> bleſſed, is applied both to God and man.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Enoſh,</hi> the Hebrew word for <hi>Man</hi> (of whom happineſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der correction is predicated) is very ſutable to this buſineſſe of correction. <hi>Enoſh</hi> ſignifies a ſickly, weake, miſerable man: We might render the full ſence of the word thus, <hi>Happy is that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, whom God corrects.</hi> That is look upon a man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinary account of the world, and calculation of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he is a miſerable man, a weake, ſickly man; yet happy is this weake, ſickly, miſerable man in the account of God, and by the calculation of faith. <hi>Grace makes that good ſence, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, both in nature and in reaſon, A miſerable man, and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man, one and the ſame.</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. the word <hi>Iſh</hi> is uſed, <hi>Bleſſed is the man,</hi> that is, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that excellent man, that holy man, that ſtrong man, walking and delighting in the Law of the Lord.

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet bleſſedneſſe is joyned with all the words, by which man is expreſſed. It is joyned with <hi>Adam,</hi> Pſal 32. 1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquity is forgiven. Adam</hi> is the generall word for Man, and is therefore moſt fitly joyned with bleſſedneſſe in pardon of ſinne, becauſe all men are ſinners, and no man can be bleſſed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be pardoned.

                  <p>I muſt yet put in a caution for the right underſtanding of this propoſition, <hi>Bleſſed is the man, whom God corrects.</hi> The meaning is not, as if happineſſe were the portion of every miſerable man, or of every man that is afflicted, doe not thinke ſo; many are at once, corrected and curſed, troubled and miſerable in trouble. To many, their preſent ſorrows, are but the fore-taſts of eternall ſorrowes; As Chriſt ſpake in a common caſe; <hi>Theſe things are but the beginning of ſorrowes:</hi> So we may ſay to the particular caſes of many groaning under ſickneſſe, poverty, diſgrace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas, poore ſoules, ye are ſo far from being happy in theſe, that theſe are but the beginnings of your unhappineſſe; God doth but begin to call for ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares, due to his juſtice, which you muſt be a paying and ſatisfying to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>There is no happineſſe in affliction naturally conſidered; it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall to afflictions, that happineſſe is aſſociated with them. Affliction in it ſelfe is grievous and it would be only ſo to us, did not the over-ruling, admirable diſpenſations of God, temper, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, diſpoſe, and worke it to an end above its own nature; it is the art and wiſdome of the Phyſitian, which corrects poyſonous ſimples and ingredients ſo, as to make them medicineable. And did not the wiſedome and goodneſſe of of God, <hi>correct our correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> they would not be medicine to us, but poyſon. It is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but the hand of God with it, and in it, which makes us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>

So Levit. 19. 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer ſinne upon thy brother; thou ſhalt ſurely rebuke him. Thou ſhalt rebuke him,</hi> it is the word here uſed, that is, thou ſhalt bring ſuch arguments, as may convince him of his ſin, and lay his wickedneſſe open before him. This word is applied to corrections and afflictions in Scripture, becauſe with convictions, we feele corrections frequently joyned; The Lord argues the matter, and (as it were) diſputes with ſome very long, who yet will not let in divine truth, nor be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though they are perſwaded; What doth he then? Then he ſends correction with his redargution, he cloaths his words with blowes, diſputes with a God in his hand, and brings an argument from feeling, when reaſoning prevailes not. In this booke of <hi>Job, Elihu</hi> ſhewes it, Chap. 33. 16, 19. <hi>Then he openeth the eares of men, and ſealeth their inſtruction, he is chaſtened alſo with paine upon his bed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That afflictions to the children of God at ſoreſt, are but correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bleſſed (or happie) is the man whom God corrects.</hi> You will ſay, but what is a correction? And how (in a ſtrict ſence) diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced from judgements and puniſhments, and wherein doe they agree?</p>
                  <p>They agree firſt in the efficient cauſe. God layes his hand on man in both.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They agree in the matter; the ſame evill, the ſame trouble to one man, is a correction, to another a judgement.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they may agree alſo in the degree; A trouble or an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction may fall and lie as heavy, and be as painfull to ſence upon a child of God, as upon the vileſt wretch in the world; he may be as poore, as friendleſſe, as ſicke, as ſorrowfull in his outward man, as any wicked man; he may lie in the ſame dungeon, and be bound with the ſame chaine, he may be ſlaine with the ſame ſword, burnt at the ſame ſtake, eaten up with the ſame famine. So that both in the materiality, and likewiſe in the graduality of it, it may be the ſame on both, yet, upon one it is a correction, upon the other, a judgement.</p>
                  <p>What then is this correction? And where will the correction and the judgement part?</p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:40455:163"/>
                  <p> I conceive, that the infirmities of the Saints, and the ſins of the wicked differ, as judgements and corrections differ. Now look upon thoſe ſins, which we call the infirmities of the Saints; they may be the ſame in the matter, the ſame in kind, yea (poſſibly) the ſame in the degree (I meane reſpecting the outward rule given by God, and the outward act committed by man) with the ſins of thoſe, who know not God, or who, in ſinning, go againſt their knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Then, where doe they part?</p>
                  <p>Surely, where corrections and judgements part. And where is that? Eſpecially in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the manner how. 2. In the end why, they are inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Lord never corrects his children with ſuch a heart, as he carries in laying trouble upon the loynes of wicked men. The heart of God is turned toward his children, when he corrects them, but his heart is turned from a wicked man; when he puniſhes him. The Lord is even pained (that I may ſpeake as the Scripture often doth in this point, after the manner of men) I ſay the Lord expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelfe as pained, as grieved, as if every ſtroake went to his owne heart, when he ſtrikes his children. When he is about to ſtrike, he is (as it were) unreſolved whether he ſhall ſtrike or no, and as ſoon as he hath ſtricken, he (as it were) repents that he did ſtrike them. All which motions of his heart the Lord ſhews us in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrains of paſſionate Rhetorick, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8, 9. But when he takes the wicked in hand to puniſh them, we reade of no paſſion aſcribed to him, but theſe, delight or joy, and the effect of them, laughter: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or indignation, and the effect of theſe mocking at them, Pro. 1. 26. <hi>I will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear cometh.</hi> And when he reſolves upon the deſtruction of his enemies, he ſpeaks as if then he had unburden'd himſelfe, and his heart were lighter then before, Iſa. 1. 24. <hi>Ah I will eaſe me of my Adverſaries, and avenge me of my enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the difference is as broad about the end. When God layes the rod of correction upon his child, he aimes at the purging out of his ſin, at the preventing of his ſin, at the revealing of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly diſpleaſure againſt him, for his ſin; The Lord would only have him take notice, that he doth not approve of him in ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. When theſe ends are propoſed every affliction is a correction. But the afflictions of the ungodly are ſent for other ends. Firſt, to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40455:164"/> take vengeance on them. Secondly, to ſatisfie offended juſtice; juſtice cries aloud againſt them, and they have nothing to interpoſe, but their bare backs or naked ſoules. The Lord comes as a ſevere Creditor, and bids them pay that which they owe, or ſuffer and to priſon, becauſe they cannot pay. Secondly, obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A child of God is in a happy condition under all corrections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As man (in a naturall or civill capacity) <hi>at his beſt eſtate is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vanity, Pſal.</hi> 39. 5. So in a ſpirituall capacity, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together happineſſe, in his worſt outward eſtate; <hi>Happy is the man whom God corrects,</hi> he is a gainer by correction: If he looſeth any thing, it is but the droſſe of his corruptions, <hi>By this therefore</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſinne:</hi> Corrections are not ſent to take away his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but to take away his corruptions. That fire which God kindles upon his children, ſhall burne only (as it did the materiall bonds of the three children in <hi>Daniel)</hi> the ſpirituall bonds of their iniquity, that they may be more free to righteouſneſſe. Againe, Crrections are not manifeſtations of wrath, but an evidence of his love, and of their ſon-ſhip: <hi>Whom I love I chaſtiſe,</hi> Rev. 3. 21. <hi>And if ye endure chaſtning, God dealeth with you as with ſons, Heb.</hi> 12. 7. The love of God is better then life, and to be a ſon of God is the higheſt priviledge of his love. Where ſhall we be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if not in that which aſſures us of ſuch love, and of love in ſuch a relation? Hence the Apoſtle concludes (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 12.) <hi>So then, death worketh in us; death,</hi> that is, our daily ſufferings and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durings. He ſpeakes (indeed) eſpecially of ſufferings for the truth, from the cruell hand of man: but it is true likewiſe of all ſufferings under the correcting hand of God: Thoſe ſtroakes which are deadly to our bodies, may yet <hi>worke for us.</hi> And what worke they? The ſeventeentth verſe anſwers the queſtion, <hi>Our light afflictions which are but for a moment, worke for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory.</hi> The ſufferings of the Saints are active, and their paſſions opperative: But how doe they worke? Not by way of merit or earning <hi>(Our blood cannot oblige God)</hi> but by way of preparation. The Lord ſends afflictions, to faſhion and cleanſe our hearts, as fit veſſels to hold an exceeding weight of glory: Our bearing the heavieſt afflictions doth not weigh ſo much as the leaſt graine of glory, yet they fit our hearts for an <hi>exceedingly excellent weight of glory.</hi> We cannot ſay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, <note place="margin">

                  <p>And if any doubt, can a man be happy when his outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is gone? Doubtleſſe he may: <hi>For a man is never unhappy, but when he hath loſt that wherein happineſſe doth conſiſt:</hi> The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of a godly man, doth not conſiſt in his outward comforts, in riches, in health, in honour, in civill liberty, or humane relations; therefore in the loſſe of theſe he cannot be unhappy. His happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conſiſts in his relation to, and acceptance with <hi>God,</hi> in his title to, and union with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> While he keeps theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges (and theſe he ſhall keepe for ever) what hath he loſt, if he looſe all beſides theſe? He hath not loſt any thing diſcerneable, out of his eſtate. Suppoſe a man were worth a million of money, and he ſhould looſe a penny, would you think this man, an undone man? No: His eſtate feeles not this loſſe, and therefore he hath not loſt his eſtate. If a man ſhould buy a thouſand meaſures of corne or cloath, and ſhould looſe the given handfuls of the one, or inches of the other, would ye ſay, that this man had loſt either his corne or his cloath. All the things of the world (and they only are looſeable) which a godly man hath, are not ſo much to his eſtate as a penny to a million; They are indeed no proper part of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, they are but an additionall over-plus to his eſtate: As the handfull of graine, or inch of cloath, are no part of the meaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed or bargained for: Only ſo much that ſpeech of Chriſt imports, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdome of God and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and all other things ſhall be added or miniſtred to you;</hi> your kingdome is whole &amp; ſafe to you, though you have not theſe: Theſe things are extrinſicall and forreigne to all that, which I reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon as your eſtate: <hi>God having given us Chriſt, caſts us in the creatures,</hi> as not comming upon any account in that vaſt act of his free love and bounty: And ſhall we account him unhappy, who hath loſt theſe things, which were never brought to account as any part of his happineſſe? Then happy ſtill, though corrected. And which is yet more, correction takes nothing from the ſtock, but it addeth ſomewhat; correction brings in a revenue of profit with it: <hi>They</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, meaning our earthly parents) <hi>chaſtned us after their own pleaſurs, but he for our profit.</hi> What profit? doe houſes and lands: gold and ſilver, bloſſome from the correcting rod? Surely they may: But he meanes better profit then theſe, and a farre more noble merchandize: Gold and ſilver are poore and baſe, to the profit which comes in by chaſtnings;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:40455:165"/> grace and holineſſe come in this way: <hi>He for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holineſſe,</hi> Heb 12, 10. <hi>We want nothing of the happineſſe in heaven, but ſo much holineſſe, as we ſhall have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Surely then, whatſoever affliction takes away, it cannot take away our happineſſe, for as much as it makes us greater ſharers in, and partakers of holineſſe.</p>

It becomes the Saints to be humbled under corrections; but who hath heard them (when they were themſelves) complaining of corrections?

But Chriſt, the ſpirituall Manna, and all heavenly things, the more we have of them, and the longer we are dieted with them, the more we ſhall delight in them: Theſe will not loath us, after two, or five, or ten, or twenty dayes, or after a whole months feeding on them: No, we ſhall feed on them dayes without number, or the whole day of eternity, without any loathings; uſe and delight, ſhall never ceaſe or abate; appetite ſhall renew every moment, though our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be but one and the ſame, Yea, the Saints ſhall be ſo farr from loathing the pleaſant cup of glory, that they ought not to loath, and (Chriſt ſtrengthning them) they ſhall not loath the bitter cup of ſorrow: Their ſtomachs ſhall not turne, though dieted more then two, or five, or ten, or twenty dayes with the bread of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and the water of affliction. That is the firſt ſenſe of the word, in alluſion to nauſeating at the ſight or long uſe of meate: <hi>Loath not the chaſtning of the Lord.</hi>

We find in Scripture, afflictions compared to a cup; Our Lord Jeſus calls all his ſufferings for our ſalvation, <hi>a cup,</hi> and it was a cup tempered with the venome and poiſon, with the gall and wormewood of all our ſinnes; it was a loathſome potion indeed; and ſuch as would have turned the ſtomachs of all men and Angels

                  <p>He ſpeakes as if moſt were loth to take them downe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorts, not to loath them: Even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (ſo farre as he was partaker of our nature) ſeemed to loath the bitter cup of ſufferings. Hence he prayed hard, once, and againe, ye a third time, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me, (Mat.</hi> 26. 39.) Yet at another time, he ſpeakes as if he had been a thirſt for that cup, and angry with <hi>Peter</hi> who would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his draught, <hi>The cup which my Father giveth me, ſhall I not drinke it? Joh.</hi> 18. 11. and ſhortly after, he indeed drunke it up to the bottome. Affliction is alſo a bitter cup to the Saints, and they (as Chriſt) pray again and again, yea thrice againſt it, becauſe to ſenſe, <hi>no chaſtning ſeemeth joyous but grievous,</hi> Heb. 12. 11. through grace perſwades them to drinke it, and faith gives them a taſt of much ſweetneſſe, when they have drunke it: As a ſick man is backward to take a diſtaſtfull medicine, till his reaſon hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his ſenſe, ſo a godly man is unwilling to beare afflictions, till his faith hath overcome his reaſon; Nor can he quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the troubleſome ſmart of the rod, till he is aſſured of the <hi>peaceable fruits of righteouſneſſe</hi> which grow from it, to thoſe who are <hi>exerciſed by it.</hi> When the Apoſtle is carryed up on thoſe Eagles wings of aſſurance, to ſee a houſe not made with hands eternall in the Heavens, then he groanes earneſtly under the burden of his earthly Tabernacle, and deſires to die; yet looking upon death, he ſaw no forme or comelineſſe in that, why he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it; and therefore he ſeemes to correct himſelfe, at leaſt to draw his mind plainer with the next drop of his pen; <hi>Not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon, that mortality may be ſwallowed up of life.</hi> He ſpeakes ſomewhat like a man, who in a time of heate, haſtily ſtrips himſelfe to goe into the water, but putting a foot in, and finding it cold, calls for his cloathes againe. The Apoſtle in a true holy heate of ſpirit, had in his deſires almoſt ſtript himſelfe of his body, but putting a foot into the grave, he found that ſo cold, that he had no great mind to it, and therefore had rather keepe on the cloathing of his body, and have a ſuite of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40455:167"/> glory over it, then lay it downe. The Saints deſire to live with Chriſt, but in it ſelfe, they deſire not to die: They had rather their mortality ſhould be ſwallowed up of eternall life, then their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life ſhould be ſwallowed up of mortality. <hi>They that have grace, like not the diſunions of nature.</hi> Now, as it is in the caſe of death (which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to the Saints the laſt and greateſt affliction) ſo likewiſe in the caſe of all afflictions, which are as renewed and leſſer deaths, Though they embrace and kiſſe them (both in a holy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the will of God, and in an aſſured expectation of their own good) yet they have nothing pleaſing in them; much, which creates ſo much loathing, that the beſt doe but need counſell and encouragement to take and digeſt them.</p>
                  <p>And then if there be ſome averſneſſe even in the beſt from theſe potions of affliction, tempered with the mercy and goodneſſe of God; no wonder if there be an abhorrence in wicked men, from thoſe deadly potions, mixt only with his wrath and juſtice. The Pſalmiſt preſents the Lord to us, with a cup in his hand <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 75. 8.) <hi>In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, the wine thereof is red</hi> (which notes fierce wrath) <hi>and it is full of mixture:</hi> (This mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is of judgements, plagues, and puniſhments, this is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their cup, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.)</hi> But what will the Lord doe with this mixed cup? who ſhall ſip, at the top of the cup, he tels us not, but he is expreſſe, whoſe the bottome is, <hi>He powreth out of the ſame</hi> (ſome drops are ſpilt here and there) but the dreggs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>all the ungodly of the earth ſhall wring them out and drinke them;</hi> Alas they loath it, their ſtomacks turne at it: They have not been brought up to drink dreggs, they have had their wine well refined, and ſparkeling with ſpirits in Chriſtall glaſſes; and how can they get this down? They who have drunke ſo willingly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the cup of ſin, ſhall be forced whether they will or no to drink the cup of judgement. And it is not a ſip or two ſhall ſerve their turnes, they muſt drinke all, dreggs and all, they ſhall drinke it to the bottome, and yet they ſhall never come to the bottome; they have loved long draughts, and now they ſhall have one long enough there is eternity to the bottom: If a cup of affliction, which (in the effect) is a cup of ſalvation, be ſometime, or for a time, nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the godly, how deadly ſick will the ungodly be, who muſt for ever drinke a cup of wrath and death?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The word which, we tranſlate <hi>deſpiſe,</hi> notes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of a thing as unprfitable, or unuſefull: That which a man
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40455:167"/> deſpiſeth, he thinkes he ſhall have no good by it: <hi>Things which are unprofitable are deſpicable:</hi> So the word is uſed <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 118. 22.) <hi>The ſtone which the builders refuſed or deſpiſed, is become the head ſtone of the corner.</hi> There were maſter builders in the Church, who (when they ſurveighed all ſorts of materials or ſtones for their fabrique of faith) looking upon the perſon of Chriſt, thought him fit only to caſt out among the rubbiſh, as altogether unuſefull; They layed him by, as a refuſe-ſtone, who is the <hi>head corner-ſtone,</hi> both the ſtrength and beauty of the whole building Thus the word is very appliable to the preſent Text, refuſe not corrections, as unprofitable and uſeleſſe: Say not (as the Jewes of Chriſt, <hi>Can any good come out of Nazareth?</hi> ſo) can any good come out of chaſtnings? <hi>Deſpiſe not the chaſtning of the Almighty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And from this Notion of the word, we may obſerve a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond prejudice againſt the rod: Even the Saints are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive afflictions to be unuſefull, and that they could well enough ſpare, and be without their troubles. A naturall eye never ſees nor finds any thing but dammage by affliction; and a ſpirituall eye doth not alwayes ſee the advantage that comes by them Yea, he may ſometime ſay of an affliction, it will be my undoing, and the ruine of my houſe, and yet, afterwards find it <hi>as a corner ſtone,</hi> the choiceſt outward meanes, which (through the bleſſing of God) hath united the walls both of his ſpirituall and civill buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the frame both of grace within, and comforts without. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> hath a ſtrange Parentheſis (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6.) For having told them of their rejoycing in the ſafety of their ſpirituall eſtate, being kept (or ſecured as with a Garriſon from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) <hi>by the power of God, through faith unto ſalvation. Though now for a ſeaſon (if need be) ye are in heavineſſe through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Temptations,</hi> or afflictions. Obſerve how he puts an <hi>If need be,</hi> or a ſuppoſition of neceſſity upon the afflictions of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. As if he had ſaid, ye who are the <hi>Candidates of eternity,</hi> and heirs of ſalvation, may judge your ſelves paſt the rod or the ferula, and thinke, now ye have need of nothing but comfort or rejoycing in the hope of that ſalvation, ready to be revealed; but I tell you, you may have need of heavineſſe yet, before you come to Heaven: and of manifold temptations, for the removing or ſubduing the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of your hearts, before you enter upon your <hi>incorruptible inheritance.</hi> We are apt to conceive chaſtnings to be of no uſe, when they are as neceſſary as our daily bread; Therefore
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40455:168"/> 
                     <hi>deſpiſe not chaſtnings,</hi> as uſeleſſe or unprofitable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the word is applied often to the rejecting of a thing or perſon, as low, diſhonourable and diſgracefull: In this ſenſe alſo it is appliable here. <hi>Deſpiſe not cheſtnings;</hi> That is, doe not thinke thy ſelfe diſgrac'd when thou art chaſtiſed: the heart of man is naturally full of pride, <hi>Man is a proud peece of fleſh.</hi> Nor doth he reſent any thing more then his own diſhonour; many can beare the paine of the croſſe, better then the ſhame of the croſſe. It is very obſervable to this purpoſe, how the Apoſtle deſcribes the Lord Chriſt in his ſufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>He endureth the croſſe, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſhame:</hi> as noting, that his being above the ſhame of the croſſe, bore up his ſpirit under the croſſe. <hi>To deſpiſe ſhame,</hi> is to looke upon that, which the world counts ſhamefull, not only as deſpicable in it ſelfe, but as not hurtfull to us: When a man deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſes an enemy, as <hi>Goliah</hi> diſdained <hi>David</hi> (1 <hi>Sam</hi> 17. 42.) he preſumes himſelfe above his enemies power to hurt him: So to deſpiſe ſhame is to make nothing of it, or to thinke our ſelves no whit the worſe for it; yea rather to thinke our ſelves honoured by it, And untill in this ſenſe we can <hi>deſpiſe ſhame,</hi> we ſhall deſpiſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and the croſſe. Who is it almoſt, that finds not this the hardeſt text in all the chapter of afflictions? <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was more afraid to be mocked by the ſugitive Jewes, then to be a priſoner to the King of <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi> 38. 19. If a man be poore, preſently he thinks he is diſgraced: If he be weake he doubts he ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned: If he looſe his eſtate, he fears he ſhall looſe his credit in the world; he was a man of place, ſome body among his neighbours, but now he ſhall be ſlighted. <hi>Suffering for well doing is our crowne, ſuffering for evill doing is our ſhame, but it is our ſhame to ſuffer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>To deſpiſe</hi> a thing, notes the ſlighting of it, as if we did not think it worth while, to take any notice of it; and ſo this will be the ſenſe, <hi>Deſpiſe not thou the chaſtnings of the Lord;</hi> that is, doe not ſlight the chaſtnings, do not lightly paſſe them by, do not look upon them as inconſiderable, as not caring what God doth with thee or thine <hi>When God layes his hand upon us, he would have us lay it to our hearts.</hi> As it is our duty to be affected with mercies, ſo likewiſe with chaſtnings. If a malefactor ſhould ſay to the Judge, do what you will with me, I care not; or a child to the parent, correct me as long as you will, I care not, how unnaturall were this? This is properly to deſpiſe afflictions. Some are like Leviathan in this ſenſe <hi>(Job</hi> 41. 27.) <hi>They eſteeme iron as ſtraw, and braſſe, as rotten wood:</hi> They
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40455:168"/> make nothing of the acts or inſtruments of Gods diſpleaſure. This is groſſe diſpiſing. But beſides every undervaluing, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the correcting hand of God, hath a degree of this deſpiſing it. That exhortation ought never to be forgotten, which ſpeaketh to us, as unto children, Hebr. 12. 5. <hi>My ſon, despiſe not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> The Greek word imports, the <hi>Litling; or thinking of them little.</hi> Do not think the chaſtnings of God little, doe not little, or ſlight them <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</note> in thy thoughts. <hi>Neither faint when thou art rebuked,</hi> that is, doe not thinke thy afflictions ſo great, that thou muſt needs ſinke and faint under them. Theſe are the two extreames, into which our hearts uſually run, when chaſtnings are upon us. Some erre by neglecting the hand of God, as light; and others by fainting under it, as too heavy. As a good heart takes notice of, or will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe a little, the leaſt comfort; So it will take notice of, and not deſpiſe a little, the leaſt croſſe. When a man hath a ſmall loſſe in his eſtate, if he ſay, this will not undoe me, I can beare this, I will fare as well, and goe as fine as ever for all this, ſuch ſpeeches or thoughts are a deſpiſing of the chaſtening of the Lord. We are to obſerve the hand of God taking away, as well as giving a penny. So when a man hath a little fit of ſickneſſe; If he ſay, I ſhall rubb out this well enough, this is to deſpiſe the chaſtning of the Lord; We are to bleſſe God for every hours health, and to be ſenſible of his hand in every hours ſickneſſe, or aking joynt.</p>
                  <p>Every affliction is a meſſenger from God, it hath ſomewhat to ſay to us from Heaven, and God will not beare it, if his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers be deſpiſed, how meane ſo ever: If you ſend a child with a meſſage to a friend, and he ſlight and deſpiſe him, you will take it ill. I remember what the ſtory relates of <hi>Galienus</hi> the Emperour, who, when the report came to him, that <hi>Egypt</hi> was loſt, what then (ſaid he) cannot I live without the flax of <hi>Egypt?</hi> And when the report was brought that a great part of his dominions in <hi>Aſia</hi> was waſted: Cannot I live (ſaid he) without the delicacies of <hi>Aſia?</hi> To ſpeake thus from a principle of mortification toward the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the character of an excellent ſpirit; but to ſpeake thus from a contempt of the Providence of God, is the character of a proud, or of a ſtupid ſpirit. When we heare of the loſſe of a child, of a friend, or of a loſſe in our eſtate; To ſay, what then? I can beare that well enough, I have more children, other friends, eſtate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough beſides that, This (I ſay) is a high deſpiſing of affliction.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:40455:169"/>
                  <p> There is one thing further, in the fifth place, obſervable in this word, <hi>Despiſe not thou the chaſtnings of the Lord.</hi> The word is <note place="margin">Extenuatio eſt, nam plus ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatur quam di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>citur, ſc. maximi facito diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Domini, nihil tibi antiquius aut potius ſit, quam ut illius corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem aequo animo accipies.</note> an extenuation or a leſſening of the ſenſe. The holy Ghoſt intends more than is expreſſed; for the truth is, when he ſaith, <hi>Deſpiſe not, &amp;c.</hi> his meaning is this, ſhew reverence, highly prize and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the chaſtning of the Lord. As (for inſtance) when the Apoſtle ſaith in 1 Theſſ. 5. 20. <hi>Deſpiſe not prophecying.</hi> Doe you thinke, this is all that is due unto an Ordinance of God, that a man ſhould not deſpiſe it? Surely no, he meanes then, prize prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly, have it in great eſteeme: So in 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4. 12. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 15 when he ſaith, <hi>Let no man deſpiſe thy youth,</hi> is that all the holy Ghoſt meanes? That <hi>Timothy</hi> a godly Paſtour ſhould only not be deſpiſed by his people? No, his meaning is, that they ſhould honour, reſpect and reverence him, as one that watched over them in the Lord. I might give you divers other Scriptures, where when the holy Ghoſt only forbiddeth the ſin, he intendeth the duty or grace in ſtricteſt oppoſition to that ſin. So here, <hi>Deſpiſe not thou the chaſtning of the Almighty;</hi> layes this charge and duty upon us, highly to eſteeme the chaſtning of the Lord, we muſt put afflictions amongſt our comforts and rank them with our bleſſings. Not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, is but the firſt ſtep beyond ſin, but that includes the laſt and furtheſt ſtep of duty, which becomes us under chaſtenings. <note place="margin">

                  <p>So much of the act forbidden, <hi>deſpiſing.</hi> Now, for the object, <hi>chaſtning.</hi> The originall verb fignifies to inſtruct, or to teach; ſo it is tranſlated, Chap. 4. v. 3. <hi>Thou haſt inſtructed many.</hi> Inſtruction is both by words and blowes. The wiſdome of God mixes a rod with his word, and chaſtening with teaching: Therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly uſed in Scripture, ſometime for teaching, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for chaſtning. Chaſtning belongs properly to children, who are wanton and ungovern'd, who have a bundle of folly in their hearts, which the rod of correction driveth out. <hi>To be chaſtned</hi> hath a double aſpect upon us, firſt upon our priviledge. Secondly, upon our weakneſſe. To be chaſtned notes our priviledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as children, unto God our father. He hath revenges for his enemies, but chaſtnings are a part of his childrens portion; yet in that we are chaſtned, it taxes us of weakneſſe; we are but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, fooliſh, unruly, wanton, and therefore we goe almoſt all our dayes, with a rod at our backs.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40455:169"/> what themſelves ſhall be in Heaven, are children, and therefore they have what fits their ſtate, <hi>chaſtening and correction.</hi> This <hi>chaſtening</hi> is ſometime put for revenge, or the exacteſt and ſevereſt retribution of juſtice; Thus it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 22. That the fooliſh young man caught by the ſubtill harlot, <hi>went after her as a foole to the correction of the ſtocks;</hi> That is, as a wicked man goes to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And when the Prophet deſcribes the ſufferings of Chriſt which were vindictive in the higheſt degree; he expreſſes it in this word, <hi>The chaſtizement of our peace was upon him</hi> (Iſa. 53. 5.) though Chriſt were the infinitely and moſt entirely beloved Son of his Father, yet he did not chaſtize him as a Son, but as an enemy or malefactour, for he chaſtened him in our ſtead, and under the ſame notion, that we muſt have been chaſtened, who were enemies and malefactors. So then, the word ſignifies ſometime judiciary chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but here fatherly chaſtening, which will yet appeare more clearely, in opening the laſt terme of this verſe, which ſhewes us the efficient cauſe of this chaſtening. <hi>The Almighty.</hi>

The mother ſtrikes the child a little blow with one hand, and gives it the breaſt with the other, ſhe gives it a little tap with one hand, and a ſpoon with the other. Conſider your chaſtnings, they are the chaſtnings of <hi>Shaddai,</hi> who, as a tender mother, hath a breaſt ready to nouriſh, and a ſpoon to feed, while he chides or chaſtens.

                  <p>This verſe containes an exemplification of the former ground, why we ſhould not deſpiſe the <hi>chaſtning of the Almighty:</hi> For, if it ſhould be objected againſt the former aſſertion <hi>(Happy is the man whom God correcteth)</hi> Where is this happineſſe? Is there happineſſe in ſores and wounds, in ſickneſſe and weakneſſe, in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and in wants?

If your faith cannot come up to believe this, ſtay but a while, and your ſence ſhall teach it you. Who would not be glad of a wound, when he knows he ſhall have <hi>Shaddai</hi> for his Chyrurgion. If you will not allow a man is happy, when he is ſore will you not allow him happy, when his ſore is bound up by ſuch a hand? If you will not grant a man is happy, when wounded, you cannot deny him happy, when he is thus healed. The Almighty will not leave them in their ſores, in their wounds: As he hath a rod, ſo he hath a ſwath, as he hath a ſword, ſo a ſalve.

                  <p>An ignorant man would wonder to ſee a Chyrurgion, when he comes for healing, make the wound wider, yet ſo he muſt do, and he doth it upon urgent reaſons.

                  <p>Secondly, Take the words in the plaine rendring of them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely thus much, that God makes ſore, and bindeth up: So we have two diſtinct acts, often aſcribed to God in a figure, to ſet forth judgement and mercy, the afflictions, and deliverances of his people, <hi>(Hoſ.</hi> 6. 2.) <hi>Let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torne, and he will heale us, he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up,</hi> (1 Sam. 2. 6.) <hi>The Lord killeth and maketh alive,</hi> (Deut. 32. 39.) <hi>See now, that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me, I kill, and I make alive, I wound and I heale.</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As God is the great correcter and inſtructer of his people, ſo he is the great Phyſitian of his people; If he make a wound, he will take care for the healing of it; He doth not make ſores, and leave others to bind up. Mighty men wound, but they take no care for healing; they can impoveriſh and ſpoyle, but they care not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire; they can pull down and root up; let who ſo will build and plant. <hi>Shaddai the Almighty God</hi> doth both: If he break thy head, come to him, humble thy ſelfe before him, and he will ſurely give thee a plaiſter, which ſhall coſt thee nothing but the asking. And whereas <hi>he doth not willingly afflict or grieve,</hi> he doth moſt willingly comfort and heale the children of men, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 33. He ſpeaks of it as a paine to himſelfe to make us ſore, but to make us ſound is his delight and pleaſure. Satan is the <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond branch of the verſe <hi>[He woundeth, and his hands make whole]</hi> is but a repetition of the ſame thing, yet with ſome addition to, or heightning of the ſence.

                     <hi>God ſometimes makes very deep and great wounds in his own ſervants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such wounds, as by the ſight of the eye, you cannot diſtinguiſh them from the wounds of his mortall enemies. He ſtrikes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough both heads and hearts of his own people: Or as <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaid to the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Luke 2. 35. <hi>A ſword pierceth through their ſoule alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then laſtly note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God never makes a wound too great for his own cure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The power of God to ſave, is as great as his power to deſtroy, his healing power and his wounding power, are of the ſame extent; His juſtice cannot out-act his mercy, both are infinite.</p>
                  <p>And not onely doth he heale the wounds which himſelfe makes, but he can heale the wounds which men make; even all the wounds which the utmoſt power and malice of man can make. He is able to doe more good, to ſhew more mercy than all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are able to doe hurt or miſchiefe. We finde the ſtate and condition of a people ſometimes ſo wounded and ſick, that men have deſpaired of recovery; Being conſulted, they may anſwer, your ſore cannot be bound up, and your wound cannot be healed, your eſtate is gangren'd and paſt cure: So he ſaid as was toucht before <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 3 8.) <hi>In that day ſhall a man ſweare ſaying, I will not be an healer, for in my houſe is neither bread nor cloathing;</hi> Alas, I heale you, I cannot heale you, your troubles are paſt my skill to remedy or redreſſe. Thus man is ſometimes at a ſtand, he
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40455:173"/> cannot heale what men have wounded; but God is never at a ſtand, your old feſtred ſores, and wrankled wounds which have taken wind, diſcourage not his chirurgery. When a people are in ſuch a pickle or pittifull plight, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribes the kingdome of <hi>Judah,</hi> in Chap. 1. 5 6. <hi>The whole head is ſicke, and the whole heart is faint, from the ſole of the foot even unto the head, there is no ſoundneſſe in it, but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores; they have not been cloſed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oyntment.</hi> When (I ſay) the caſe of a people is thus, and they can get no healer: Yea though a people (like the woman, <hi>Mark</hi> 5 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>have had an iſſue of blood</hi> (in bloody battels, which is now almoſt <hi>Englands</hi> caſe) <hi>many yeares; and have ſuffered many things of many Phyſitians, and have ſpent all that they have, and are nothing bettered, but rather grow worſe; yet if Chriſt doe but touch ſuch a ſicke, diſeaſed bleeding people in mercy, and they touch him by faith, they ſhall be healed, and their fountaine of blood will immediately dry up.</hi> Or if their condition requires ſome lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger operation, he can effectually take ſuch a courſe for their cure: He is abundantly furniſhed with all inſtruments and abilities for the making of a perfect cure.</p>
                  <p>It is well obſerved, that three things are neceſſary for a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He muſt have an <hi>Eagles eye,</hi> one that is good at healing, had need be good at ſeeing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He muſt have a <hi>Ladies hand,</hi> ſoft and tender to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the ſore gently.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A <hi>Lions heart, a ſtout ſtrong heart,</hi> for if he faint, how ſhall his patient keep up his courage?</p>
                  <p>Theſe three are exceeding neceſſary in Chyrurgery about natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodies, but much more in Chyrurgery about Civill and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical bodies, the healing of Churches and Kingdoms. And where ſhall we find, whither ſhall we ſend for Phyſitians, qualified with this <hi>Eagles eye,</hi> to look into all our ſores and ſickneſſes? with this <hi>Ladies hand,</hi> to deal gently and tenderly with our wounds? with this <hi>Lions heart,</hi> ſtoutly and couragiouſly without fears and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to go thorough with the work? Well, if men ſhould not be found thus furniſhed, the Lord is; He hath an <hi>Eagles eye,</hi> an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing eye, ſeven eyes of providence and wiſdome, to look through our ſores, and into all our diſtempers: He hath (as in alluſion we may ſpeak) a <hi>Ladies hand,</hi> ſoft and tender, to deal gently and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40455:174"/> with a people; He can dreſſe our wounds, and paine us lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſcarce be felt while he doth it. And he hath the <hi>Lions heart,</hi> infinite courage and ſtrength of ſpirit, to undertake the moſt gaſtly wounds or ſwolne putrified ſores. Let us therefore reſt our ſelves aſſured, that whatſoever our perſonall or our nationall ſores, our perſonall or our nationall wounds be, be they what they will, or what we can call them, deſperate, incurable, ſuch as have diſcourag'd many from medling with their cure, or ſham'd thoſe that have; yet our <hi>Shaddai</hi> the Almighty God, can bind them up and heale them, fetch the core from the bottome, and cloſe the skin upon the top, ſo tenderly dreſſe, and ſo perfectly cure them, that a ſcarre ſhall not remaine, unleſſe it be to mind us of his infinite skill and goodneſſe or of our own duty and thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                     </note> the hand of an enemy, out of the mouth of danger.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew word for <hi>[Trouble]</hi> comes from a roote, which ſignifies to ſtraiten or to narrow a thing up in a little compaſſe; and ſo by a metaphor, to vex and trouble, becauſe they who are ſtraitned in any kind, are pained and troubled. And when we heare of any in trouble, we uſually ſay, ſuch are in ſtraits. And this word is often tranſlated, <hi>a ſtrait,</hi> (2 Sam. 24. 14.) <hi>I am in a great ſtrait,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> when he was put upon that hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, between ſword, peſtilence and famine. So <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. 7. and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 6.</p>
                  <p>The holy language, expreſſes an enemy or adverſary by this word, becauſe an enemy puts us upon ſtraits, and ſo, to much trouble.</p>
                  <p>And to raiſe the force of this word to the higheſt, it is uſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the pangs and throwes of women in child-bearing, in which the mother labours in grievous ſtraits, while the infant labours for enlargement. Troubles ever meet us in, or bring us into ſtraits, they may well change names, which are ſo neere in nature; I find the word ſo tranſlated here in ſome books, <hi>He ſhall deliver thee in ſix ſtraits, and in ſeven,</hi> when thou art ſo encompaſt about, ſhut in and incircled by evils on every ſide, that thou knoweſt not which way to move or turne, much leſſe to get out, then the Lord will give enlargement, and either find a way out for thee, or make one, as he did for <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the red ſea, through thoſe mighty waters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In ſix, yea in ſeven.]</hi> This phraſe of ſpeech, is very conſiderable. Some numbers in Scripture, have a kind of eminency or excellency in them: I intend not any large diſcourſe about numbers; only in briefe. Thoſe three numbers, Three, Six and Seven, are applied to a ſpeciall ſignification by the Holy Ghoſt. A great number, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect number, is expreſſed by any one of theſe three numbers; <hi>A three-fold cord,</hi> (that is, a cord of many or ſufficient folds) <hi>is not eaſily broken,</hi> Eccleſ. 4. 12. <hi>Three times thou ſhalt keepe a feaſt to me in the yeare,</hi> Exod. 23. 14. <hi>Three times in a yeare all thy males ſhall appeare before the Lord,</hi> ver. 17. The candleſtick had <hi>three branches, Exod.</hi> 25. 32. and three cubits was the height of the Altar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>Three Cities</hi> of refuge were appontinted for
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40455:175"/> the manſlayer, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 7. and the addition made, is of another <hi>three.</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Three witneſſes</hi> gave the compleateſt evidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireable, as <hi>Two,</hi> the leaſt admittable in the law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 6. That (beſides a rule) there was a myſtery in moſt of theſe, I think no man doubts, though what the myſtery was, may be preſumption in any man to determine. Of this we are ſure, that the higheſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and perfection of all <hi>numbers</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> is found in <hi>One Three. That Three in One, The ſacred Trinity;</hi> And in the common ſpeech of moſt, if not of all languages, <hi>Thrice happy, Thrice great, Thrice honourable,</hi> note a man advanced to the very pinnacle of <hi>Happineſſe, Greatneſſe</hi> and <hi>Honour, The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Three, or the Numeral Thrice, imply a compleatneſſe in all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the number ſix notes perfection, may be ſeene in the work of Creation; The Lord could as eaſily have made the world in ſix or in one moment, as in ſix dayes: but the Lord ſaw it good, to take a compleate number of dayes, for ſo compleate a worke. God threatens <hi>Gog,</hi> his perfect and compleate enemy, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate puniſhment, or with judgement in perfection. <hi>(The juſtice of God can be as compleate in puniſhing, as the malice of man can be in ſinning.)</hi> Ezek. 39. 2. <hi>I am againſt thee O God, the chiefe Prince of Meſhech and Tubal, I will turne thee backe, and leave but the ſixth part of thee,</hi> ſo we tranſlate; yet in the margin of our books, we find the Hebrew thus; <hi>I will ſtrike thee with ſix plagues,</hi> or, <hi>I will draw thee back with a hooke of ſix teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seven is a famous number, implying, Firſt multitude, Secondly perfection: <hi>The barren hath borne ſeven</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hannah</hi> in her ſong, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 5.) that is, many ſhe is a compleate mother, ſhe hath a flouriſhing family, many children. And in oppoſition to this <hi>(Jer.</hi> 15. 9.) <hi>She that hath born ſeven languiſheth,</hi> that is, ſhe that had many children, now hath none. Seven devils were caſt out of the woman <hi>(Luk.</hi> 8. 2.) that is, a multitude of devils: So the <hi>ſeven Spirits, the ſeven Churches, the ſeven Trumpets, the ſeven Seales, the ſeven Vials, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſpeake the compleatneſſe and perfection of each in their kind; whether good or evill: and that is appliable to the particular ſenſe of the text, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 24. 16.) <hi>The juſt falleth ſeven times a day;</hi> that is, he falleth often, almoſt continually into trouble, and yet <hi>he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againe, God delivers him.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Shebange,</hi> is neere in ſound to our Engliſh <hi>ſeven;</hi> and to note that ſeven
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40455:175"/> is a compleate full number, the ſame Hebrew word ſignifies <hi>ſeven,</hi> and <hi>full, ſeven</hi> and <hi>ſatisfied or compleate.</hi> And the word to <hi>ſwear,</hi>

                  <p>But to paſſe from ſingle numbers, I ſhall conſider them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or conjunction, as here ſix and ſeven. <hi>He ſhall deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea in ſeven there ſhall no evill touch thee:</hi> Some underſtand this ſtrictly and preciſely of thoſe two numbers ſix and ſeven; And expound the text by the enumeration of thoſe ſix or ſeven particular evils made by <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in the following verſes; For having ſaid in generall, that God will deliver his in ſix troubles and in ſeven, he reckoneth up ſeverall troubles, and gives us (as it were) a catologue, or a particular of thoſe evils by name, amounting to ſix or ſeven; As 1. Famine, 2. Warre, 3. Scourge of the tongue, 4. Deſtruction. 5. Evill beaſts, 6. Hurtfull ſtones; here are ſix, and if a ſeventh evill come upon thee, <hi>in ſeven no evill ſhall touch thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I rather take this expreſſion, <hi>ſix, yea ſeven,</hi> to be a fixed number put for an unfixed, a certaine number for an uncertaine, and that uncertaine number to be a great number, the greateſt number, any number imaginable. We find this kind of ſpeaking frequently in Scripture; In the thirty third of this booke of <hi>Job,</hi> v. 29. <hi>Loe theſe things God workes twice and thrice;</hi> which we tranſlate, <hi>theſe things God workes often-times, when numbers are doubled with an increaſe in the latter, it notes a mighty growth of the whole number. Twice and twice</hi> (we know) is but foure times; but, <hi>twice and thrice,</hi> may be more then five times, <hi>twice and thrice, is oftentimes, no man knowes how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find the number next above this in the ſame ſignification; <hi>Three, and foure,</hi> are put for many, very many; <hi>(Amos</hi> 1. 3.) <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Damaſcus, and for foure:</hi> Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of three or foure ſpeciall ſins, of which <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was chiefely guilty: namely, 1.

Oppreſſion: Or, Three may be taken for a <hi>Cardinal</hi> number, and Foure for an <hi>Ordinal;</hi> for the <hi>Fourth,</hi> as if ſome fourth ſin were ſo ſinfull, and had ſuch a malignity in it as the Lord would not pardon. Thus <hi>Foure</hi> is put for the fourth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 15, 18, 21, 29. <hi>Three things are never ſatisfied, yea foure things ſay</hi>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:40455:176"/> 
                     <hi>not it is enough.</hi> That is, a <hi>fourth thing (ſc.</hi> fire being the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable of all the reſt) ſaith not it is enough The copulative particle <hi>(and)</hi> is often in Scripture taken comparatively; for <hi>much more.</hi> Pſal. 125. <hi>The mountaines are round about Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and the Lord is about his people:</hi> So the Hebrew; we tranſlate by <hi>a comparative of ſimilitude.

                  <p>We read of many great Famines in Scripture, and withall of Gods care to redeem his people from them. <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 12. who (at the call of God) denied himſelf, and came out of his own, into a ſtrange Land, was preſently entertained with Famine. One would have thought, God ſhould have made him good chear, and have ſpread a plentifull table for him, cauſing his cup to over-flow, while he was in a ſtrange Land, and a meer ſtranger there; yet he met with a famine, but the Lord redeemed him from that famine, by directing him to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that famous ſtore houſe for his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:40455:179"/> 
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> and his ſons were redeemed from famine, in the ſame <hi>Egypt,</hi> afterward their <hi>houſe of Bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a precious comfort to have bread in ſuch a promiſe as this, when there is none upon the Board.</hi> God takes care for the bodies of his people as well as for their ſouls, he is the father of both, and the provider for both. And while we remember what ſore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions have bin upon many Nations and people by famine; While we remember <hi>Samaria's Famin,</hi> 2 Kings 6. <hi>Jeruſalems Famin,</hi> Lam. 4. and that ſtoried by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſiege of that City; While we remember the late famins in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the preſent one in many parts of <hi>Ireland;</hi> While we conſider, that the Sword threatens <hi>this Nation</hi> with famine: Surely we ſhould labour to get under ſuch a promiſe as this is, that we may plead with God in the midſt of all ſcarcity and wants; Lord thou haſt promiſed to redeem <hi>Thine in famin from death: There is no dearth in Heaven: And whatſoever dearth is on Earth, the plenty that is in Heaven can ſupply it.</hi> How ſad would it be, if your poor children ſhould come about you, crying for bread, and you have none to give them; How much ſadder would it be, if your poor children ſhould be made your bread, and ground to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between your teeth, as in the famin of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> In ſuch a time, to look up to God in the ſtrength of this promiſe, will be a <hi>feaſt to us,</hi> though we ſhould periſh in the famin.</p>
                  <p>But how doth God redeem from famin?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Lord can make the barrell of meal, and the oyle that is in the cruze, though but little yet to hold out and laſt, while the time of famine laſts; Such a miracle redeemed the poor widdow from death, in that great famin, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He can redeem by lengthning one meal, to many days. <hi>Elijah</hi> went forty dayes in the ſtrength of one dinner. <hi>Man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not by bread without God, but man may live by God without bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Not onely are the ſtores of the creatures his, and the fruitfulneſſe of the earth at his command, but if he pleaſe he can open the windows of Heaven; he can bring bread out of the clouds; he can make the winds his Caterers to bring in Quails and abundance of proviſion for his people. Thus alſo he can redeem his from death, in the time of famine.</p>
                  <p>Or fourthly, He can doe it in a way of ordinary providence, by making the land yeeld it's naturall increaſe, and by giving
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40455:180"/> ſtrength to the Earth, to bring forth plentifully, for the uſe of man.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, While the common judgement laſts, he can make ſome ſpeciall proviſion for his; And make a redemption of diviſion, as he did in another caſe for his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 22.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, We may improve this promiſe, not only for redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from death in famine, but for plenty of conſolation, though we ſhould die in famine. When the bread is quite taken away from your Table; your hearts may feed upon ſuch a word as this, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on marrow and fatneſſe. Chriſt can feaſt your ſoules, when your bodies are ready to ſtarve, he can fill your ſpirits with joy and ſweetneſſe, when there is nothing but leanneſſe in your cheeks; Thus the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> triumphs in God <hi>(Habak.</hi> 3. 17.) <hi>Though the Fig-tree ſhall not bleſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines, the labour of the Olive ſhall faile, and the fields ſhall yeeld no meat; The flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls: Yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> He was feaſting upon God, while he imagines the world ſtarving; he ſees all things in God, though the world ſhould afford him nothing. That ſoule is well fed and taught, which can be rejoycing, while it's own body is ſtarving.</p>

                     </note> be ſet before war, yet uſually war is the fore-runner of famine. The ſword cuts off proviſion, and when it ſelfe hath <hi>devoured much fleſh,</hi> it leaves no bread for thoſe who ſurvive. It is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the originall word for war here uſed, comes from a root ſignifying to eat or to devoure, and ſo by a <hi>Metaphor</hi> it ſignifies to fight, or ſtrike with the ſword. And the reaſon, why the ſame word, which ſignifies war, ſignifies to eat, is becauſe the <hi>Sword</hi> is ſuch an <hi>Eater</hi> or rather a <hi>Devourer,</hi> and it eats two ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Sword eats up the bodies of men, drinks up their bloud, diſpeoples a Land; And then</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It eates up and conſumes the fruits of the earth, and hence War is the mother of Famine. Therefore we find, that when the great peace and ſo the plenty of the Church of Chriſt is
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40455:180"/> prophecied of, and deſcribed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 4. and in <hi>Micah,</hi> it is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>They ſhall beat their ſwords into plow ſhares, and their ſpeares into pruning-hookes.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, while the ſword is abroad in the field, the plow ſhares will do little there; For the moſt part Juſtice is ſilent in time of war <hi>(the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi>

                     <hi>and drum, is too loud for the Law)</hi> and when the Law ſtands ſtill, the plongh ſtands ſtill; Therefore when the ſword is in motion, both are at a ſtand. Hence the promiſe, that <hi>Swords ſhall be beaten into plow-ſhares, and speares into pruning-hookes,</hi> that is, with peace, you ſhall have bread and wine, which note the abundance of all other things. The ancients embleam'd peace by <hi>Eares of corne,</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> by (a <hi>Cornu-copia) a horne of plenty;</hi> riches are the fruit of peace: And ſafety is the priviledge of the Saints in time of war, <hi>In war they ſhall be delivered from the power of the ſword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>They ſhall be delivred from, or out, of the hand of the ſword:</hi> Sometime in Scripture we read of the <hi>face of the ſword,</hi> which notes the ſword coming and approaching to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; And ſometimes we read of the <hi>mouth of the ſword,</hi> which notes the ſword come, devouring and eating up a people; And here we have the <hi>hand of the ſword,</hi> they ſhall be delivered out of the <note place="margin">Gladius manu apprehenſus &amp; elevatus, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum eſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremi diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentis hoſtis: Quaſi diceret etiam in ipſa pugna vel inter tot manus gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dios agitantes &amp; contra te vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantes ſalvabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note> 
                     <hi>hand of the ſword,</hi> which notes (as we tranſlate) <hi>the power of the ſword:</hi> Or, that forme of ſpeaking may be underſtood by an <hi>Hypallage, From the hand of the ſword,</hi> that is, <hi>from the ſword in the hand,</hi> which phraſe imports preſent danger; when the ſword is unſheathed and drawn out, when it is in the hand ready to ſtrike, then the enemy is ready to charge, and then the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; He ſhall deliver from the ſword in the hand, or out of the hand of the ſword. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 4. <hi>Children of the youth, are as arrowes in the hand of the mighty,</hi> that is, as arrowes ready to be ſhot. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 6. <hi>Let the high praiſes of God be in their mouthes, and a two edged ſword in their hands;</hi> noting actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges taken on the enemies of God, and actuall praiſes given to the name of God, at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>So then, the meaning of theſe words, <hi>He ſhall deliver thee from the power of the ſword, or out of the hand of the ſword,</hi> is this, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou art in ſuch a condition that the ſwords are drawn about thy eares, and thou art in the midſt of a thouſand deaths and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, in the very heat of a battell, yet then the Lord God can and will deliver thee.</p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:40455:181"/>
                  <p> And this likewiſe is a comfortable promiſe, for us to lay hold on, in theſe times. It is a time of war to us all, and there are many of our friends and brethren (as it were) in the very hand of the ſword; Deſires are often ſent to the Congregation, by one for a husband, by another for a brother, by a third for a ſervant, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for their friends, gone forth to meet a ſword in the hand of an enemy skilfull to deſtroy: Here is a promiſe, to comfort and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch; The Lord in time of war, can deliver out of the very hand of the ſword, or, when ſwords are in hand; when thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſwords are drawn together, preparing for, or ſmiting in the day of battell; know, then God is a deliverer. <hi>In the moſt preſent dangers, God ſhews the moſt preſent help.</hi> (Pſal. 23. 5.) <hi>Thou ſhalt spread my table and cauſe my cup to overflow, before the face of my enemy,</hi> even then, when my enemy is neareſt and looketh on. As when the ſword is in the hand of the Angel, ſo when it is in the hand of man, <hi>A thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thouſand at thy right hand, but it ſhall not come nigh thee, (Pſal.</hi> 91. 7.) Not nigh thee? what? when they die on this ſide and one that ſide, on every hand of a man, doth it it not come nigh him? Yes, nigh him, but not ſo nigh, as to hurt him; <hi>The power of God can bring us nigh to danger, and yet keep us far from harme:</hi> As good may be locally near us, and yet vertually far from us, ſo may evill; The multitude throng'd Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and yet but one toucht him, ſo as to receive good; ſo Chriſt can keep us in a throng of dangers, that not one ſhall touch us, to our hurt.</p>
                  <p>Yet we are not to take this or the like holy <hi>writs of protection,</hi> as if God would deliver all his people, from famine and from the ſword; we know many precious ſervants of his have fallen by theſe common calamities; The Lord knows how to diſtinguiſh his, when ſword and famine doe not. Neither doth this word fall, though they doe: If the ſervants of Chriſt are not delivered from theſe troubles, they are delivered by them, and <hi>while they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by one trouble, they conquer all.</hi>

As, when a report is rung in the eare, that an invading enemy, ſpoylers and plunderers, arm'd with power and malice are at hand to take away eſtates, liberties and lives. How many have bin beaten about the ears, and ſcourg'd with ſuch <hi>Alarums?</hi> (Jer. 50. 43.) it is ſaid, <hi>The King of Babylon hath heard the report of them:</hi> what report was it? and of whom? A ſpie rides in, and kills the King with his tongue, ſtrikes him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough with his tongue, before he was toucht with the ſword of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians:</hi> How? He brought him a ſad report, that the enemy was upon his march, then it follows, <hi>The King of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble, anguiſh took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travell.</hi> We find the like expreſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 18, 19. They who had ſlighted the judgements of God, and ſaid, <hi>when the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe thorough, it ſhould not come neare them,</hi> even theſe (ſaith God) ſhall be vext, when they doe but heare of a ſcourge co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neare: <hi>I will ſend a report, and it ſhall paſſe over morning by morning, and it ſhall travell by day and by night;</hi> and what ſhall be the effect of it? <hi>It ſhall be a vexation</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>onely to underſtand the report.</hi> You ſhall not onely be vexed when the enemy is come, and thruſts a ſword into your bowells, and fire into your houſes, but you ſhall be vext at the noiſe of his coming, <hi>it ſhall be a vexation to you to heare the report.</hi> It is a great mercy to be delivered and hid from this ſcourge of the tongue, and this is promiſed him who feares God, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 112. 7.) <hi>No evill tydings ſhall make him afraid. A heart which hath trembled at the voice of God instructing him, ſhall not tremble at the voice of men reporting evill to him.</hi> Many a man is more afraid than hurt, and more perplexed with the <hi>hearing</hi> of evill tydings, then others are with ſeeing or feeling the evill. The Lord threatens <hi>Ely,</hi> to doe ſuch a thing in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and againſt his houſe, <hi>that both the</hi>

The <hi>ancient Chriſtians</hi> in the Primitive times, were deepely wounded by the ſcourge of the tongue, what ſtrange things did ungodly men feigne and then faſten on them?

No; Chriſtians loved one another to the amazement of Heathens: They were ſo farre from this ſcourging or wounding of one another, that they were ready to be ſcourged, to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to be burned, to die one for another. This cauſed their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan perſecuters to cry out, <hi>Behold how the Chriſtians love one another?</hi> We are ſcourged by wicked ones, as <hi>They,</hi> O that we could love one another, as <hi>They.</hi> Sons of Belial have revived the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40455:184"/> ancient reproaches and accuſations againſt the brethren, O, that we could revive the ancient imbraces and moſt endeared affections of the Brethren Obſerve, ſecondly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a great mercy to be delivered from the Scourge of the tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks of it, as a wonderfull mercy, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of the <hi>Mouth of the Lion</hi> (2 Tim. 4. 17.) Surely it is no ordinary mercy (though lying be very ordinary) to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the <hi>Mouth of a lyar.</hi> This is joyned in one promiſe, with deliverance from the moſt deadly inſtrumenrs of warre, Iſa 54. 17. <hi>No weapon formed againſt thee ſhall proſper,</hi> that is no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of warre, neither Sword nor Speare ſhall hurt thee. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>And every tongue that ſhall riſe up againſt thee in judgement thou ſhalt condemne. This is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord.</hi> The tongue of a <hi>Ziba</hi> or of a <hi>Tertullus</hi> will devour and deſtroy, as bad as the Sword of a <hi>Caeſar</hi> or a <hi>Pompey.</hi> The holy ſtory tels us, what woefull work the tongue had made upon <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth,</hi> if the good providenee of God had not ſpoken a good word for them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let me add one ſeaſonable word of admonition, to theſe tongue ſcourgers; As the word is, They that ſmite with the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword; ſo, they that ſmite with the tongue, ſhall periſh with the tongue. The tongues of the Saints are in ſome ſence, ſharper and ſorer ſcourges, then the tongues of wicked men. The word of God in their mouths, is a <hi>Two-edged Sword,</hi> yea <hi>ſharper then any Two-edged Sword.</hi> A Prophet or a Miniſter of Chriſt, can ſtrike as hard with his tongue, as (and infinitely harder, then) any Prophane wretch, or railing <hi>Rabſhakeb</hi> in the world. <hi>Truth well ſet home, will wound deeper, than ſlander can. I</hi> (ſaith the Lord, Hoſ. 6. 5.) <hi>have hewed them by my Prophets, and ſlaine them by the words of my mouth.</hi> In the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> it is prophecied, <hi>That fire ſhall goe out of the mouths of the two Witneſſes, and devour their enemies,</hi> verſ. 5. That is, the word of their mouths, ſhall be as a fire to ſcorch and conſume the gain ſaying world; and with this inſtrument their tongue (for that only is ſutable for the work of Witneſſes) they are ſaid to have <hi>tormented thoſe that dwell upon the earth,</hi> ver. 10. Some indeed are <hi>Sermon-proofe,</hi> and <hi>Word-proofe;</hi> They at preſent doe even laugh at all our ſpirituall Artillery, Let whole volleyes of threats be diſcharg'd upon them, let them be hackt and hewed all day long
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40455:185"/> with the Sword of the Word, they feele it not, it may be they jeer at it, at leaſt they regard it not. As they, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 18. conſpiring againſt the Prophet, <hi>Come let us deviſe devices, &amp;c. let us ſmite him with the tongue.</hi> And leaſt any ſhould ſay, if we ſmite him with the tongue, he will ſmite us againe; <hi>For theſe Prophets are notable at that weapon.</hi> To ſecure themſelves, they reſolve thus; <hi>Let us not give heed to any of his words.</hi> As if they had ſaid, we know he will ſpeake bigge words, and threaten us terribly, with Sword, and peſtilence, and famine, and hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let's arme our ſelves againſt him, and make no more of all, then of a <hi>Squibb or a pot-gun,</hi> then of a ſtabbe with a <hi>wooden dagger,</hi> or a charge with a <hi>Bull ruſh. Let us not give heed to any of his words.</hi> But let theſe know, though now they are hardned againſt the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſcourge and ſword, in the mouth of Chriſts Miniſters, yet at the laſt <hi>Chriſt himſelfe will ſmite them with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips ſhall he ſlay the wicked.</hi> Iſa. 11. 4. He once made a <hi>Scourge of cords,</hi> and whipt the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, he will at laſt make a <hi>Scourge of words,</hi> which ſhall whip all impenitents and unbelievers out of his preſence into hell, where they ſhall gnaſh their teeth, and gnaw <hi>Thoſe tongues,</hi> which have ſcourg'd his faithfull ſervants, with many ſtripes, only for doing or ſpeaking his, their Maſters, will.</p>

                  <p>When ſuch deſtruction comes, thou ſhalt have this priviledge, <hi>Not to be afraid of it. Not afraid,</hi> the word ſignifies any kinde of feare, holy fearing as well as naturall; here it is uſed for exceſſive, diſtracting feare. It is not meant, that a man ſhall be ſecure or ſenſleſſe, when deſtruction commeth, <hi>So to be fearleſſe, is worſe then to be reaſonleſſe.</hi> But this is the meaning, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid;</hi> That is, thou ſhalt not bee diſmayed with fear, thou ſhalt not be amazed or aſtoniſhed with feare, thou ſhalt not be at thy <hi>wits end,</hi> much leſſe at thy <hi>Faiths end,</hi> when deſtruction commeth. Feare is good in it's kind, yea it is an excellent grace; Some feare in time of deſtruction is the daughter of faith (Heb. 11. 7.) <hi>By Faith,</hi> Noah, <hi>being warned of God, of things not ſeen as yet, moved</hi>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:40455:185"/> 
                     <hi>with feare, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his houſe; He fears deſtruction ſavingly, whoſe fear moves him to prepare due means of ſafty.</hi> Such preparatory fears are holy fears, and well become the Saints, when deſtruction cometh. <hi>(Exod.</hi> 9. 20.) He that heard of the deſtruction coming, and <hi>feared the word of the Lord, made his ſervants and cattle flee into the houſes;</hi> God would not have his people, when they hear deſtruction is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſtand at the doore in a daring manner to meet it, and lay themſelves open to it, no he would have them flee into the houſe, and <hi>enter into the chamber, and ſhut the doors about them, hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it were for a little moment, untill the indignation be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt,</hi> Iſa. 26. 20.</p>
                  <p>The feare which God promiſeth his people protection from, is unbelieving frare, or feare which is the daughter of deſpaire: Such as that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 2. where, when a report came of deſtruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, it is ſaid; <hi>That the heart of the King, and the heart of his people was moved as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</hi> They were ſo afraid, ſo unſetled and diſorder'd within, that they knew not how to ſettle and order their affaires without. Such a feare the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> threatens upon <hi>Paſhur,</hi> Jer. 20. 3. <hi>The Lord hath not called thy name Paſhur, but Magor-miſſabib; For thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will make thee a terrour to thy ſelfe, and to all thy friends;</hi> Feare round about, and fear within, this feare God promiſeth to deliver his people from, in times of danger.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The power and preſence of God is able to uphold his people in the face of dangers, and in the preſence of deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſhall not be afraid of deſtruction, when it commeth: Suppoſe God doth not keepe the deſtruction off from them, yet he will keepe finking feares off from them. How terribly ſoever men looke upon them, they ſhall not be a terrour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, neither will God be a terrour to them. <hi>Many a man is his own Bugg-bear. And there is nothing can be ſo terrible to us, (except an angry God) as we may be to our ſelves.</hi> But he, to whom God is not a terrour, and to whom himſelfe is not a terrour, will not be afraid of the <hi>King of Terrours.</hi> So long as we are at peace with God and our ſelves, deſtruction cannot come ſo faſt, as conſolation will. And deſtruction cannot carry that away, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſolation lies. The beſt part of the Saints eſtate, is out of the reach of deſtroyers. They can deſtroy houſes and goods: They can
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40455:186"/> carry away gold and ſilver, but they cannot deſtroy faith and hope; shey cannot carry away, grace or holineſſe; They may burne your writings, and the evidences of your Lands and Tenements, but they cannot burne your evidences for Heaven, or weaken your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure and intereſts in Jeſus Chriſt. Upon the wings of this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the Saints are carried beyond the borders of feare when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction comes into their borders, or death is breaking open their doores, and climbing up unto their windowes. Yea this aſſurance, (which carries them beyond the confines of feare) ſets them down in a very comfortable place, in the Land of joy, or upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of delight. It is too little to ſay, <hi>They ſhall not be afraid, when deſtruction comes, for at deſtruction they ſhall laugh:</hi> As <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> undertakes with his next breath.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>At deſtruction and famine, thou ſhalt laugh; neither ſhalt thou be afraid of the Beaſts of the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. <hi>For thou ſhalt be in league with the ſtones of the field; and the Beaſts of the field ſhall be at peace with thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In the former words, we had a promiſe of redemption from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and from feare at the comming of deſtruction. Here both the mercy and the promiſe are heightned, or the promiſe is made yet more mercifull; <hi>At deſtruction and famine thou ſhalt laugh.</hi> It is a high priviledge to be redeem'd from famine, and not to be afraid of deſtruction; but to laugh at theſe is the higheſt priviledge. But is it not a ſin to laugh at theſe? And if ſo, how will it be any priviledge at all? <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man, Eccl. 2. 2.) <hi>ſaid of laughter it is madd, and of mirth, what doth it?</hi> And is not this madd laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to laugh at deſtruction, and to be merry in famine?

And to be rejoycing, when the Lord is deſtroying? To cleare this I ſhall open the ſence of the Text, and ſhew, that this <hi>Laughter is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                  <p>The word is ordinarily uſed for <hi>laughing;</hi> whence <hi>Iſaac</hi> hath his name, The ſonne of the promiſe was called <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:40455:186"/> laughed, or becauſe he rejoyced at the promiſe or birth of his ſonne, eſpecially at the promiſe of <hi>His birth, who was to be the joy and deſire of Nations, the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, who, referring to this act of <hi>Abraham,</hi> tels the Jewes, Joh. 8. 56. <hi>Your Father</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>rejoyced to ſee my day, he ſaw it and was glad. To laugh</hi> in Scripture is taken two waies.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes in a good ſenſe; and</p>
                  <p>Sometimes in an ill ſenſe,</p>
                  <p>In a good ſenſe, and ſo, <hi>To laugh is an outward expreſſion of ſound inward joy and true comfort; To laugh</hi> is an act proper to man. There cannot be true and ſolid joy (and ſo, not this effect of it, laughing) where there is not true ſolid reaſon. Even paſſion (ſtrictly taken) is founded in reaſon. In the 29. of this book <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Job</hi> deſcribing the great proſperity of his former daies, ſaith, <hi>If I laughed on them, they believed it not. Job</hi> was a man of that eſteem and veneration, that though he expreſſed in his geſture or countenance, a kind of familiarity, and how well he was pleaſed, yet the people did ſo much reverence him, and his piety and unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted juſtice did ſo over-awe them, that they ſuſpected ſtill he might obſerve ſomewhat amiſſe in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to laugh, is uſed for ſcorning and deriding. In the 39 of this book <hi>v</hi> 7. Laughter is aſcribed unto the wild Aſſe, <hi>improperly; He</hi> (ſc. <hi>the wild. Aſſe) ſcornes (or laughs at) the multitude of the City.</hi> And <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 2. 4.) when the Princes and the people gather themſelves together, to take counſell againſt the Lord and againſt his Chriſt; <hi>He that ſitteth in heaven ſhall laugh, and the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion.</hi> That is, the Lord (in a moſt holy manner) ſcornes or derides the counſels and practiſes of wicked men, <hi>Man is never in ſo ſad a condition, as when God laughs at him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Laughter proper to man, is either ſinfull and reproove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or holy and commendable. Sinfull laughter is that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from unbeliefe or weakneſſe of faith: Such was the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Sarah</hi> (Gen. 18. 12.) when the Angel brought his meſſage that <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould have a ſonne, <hi>Sarah,</hi> heard it, as ſhe was in the Tent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>doore, and the Text ſaith, <hi>Sarah laughed:</hi> The ground of her laughter was unbeliefe, ſhe thought it an impoſſible thing, for her to have a ſon (as a man will laugh at a thing you tell him. when he thinks it impoſſible to be done. That her laughter was from unbeliefe, is plaine, from the Angels reproving queſtion in the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40455:187"/> next words; <hi>Wherefore did</hi> Sarah <hi>laugh, ſaying, ſhall I of a Jurety beare a child, which am old? Is any thing too hard for the Lord?</hi> As if he had ſaid, ſurely <hi>Sarah</hi> thinkes the Lord hath out promis'd his own power to performe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sinfull laughter ariſeth from contempt, or ſlighting of counſell, and carnall ſecurity in times of danger (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 10.) when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſent meſſengers to <hi>Ephraim and Manaſſeh</hi> to warn them to come up to the houſe of the Lord, to keepe the Paſſeover, it is ſaid, That <hi>they laughed the meſſengers to ſcorn and mocked them;</hi> they laughed, ſlighting and contemning this admonition, thinking themſelves ſafe and well enough, though they came not up to that ſolemne Paſſeover.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sinfull laughter ariſes from pride and ſelfe-confidence, <hi>(Hab.</hi> 1. 10.) The Prophet deſcribes the proud <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading <hi>Judah;</hi> thus, <hi>They ſhall ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffe at the Kings, and Princes ſhall be a ſcorn unto them, and they ſhall deride every ſtrong-hold.</hi> They ſhall come up with ſuch an army, with ſuch an arm of fleſh, as all fleſh muſt fall downe and yeeld unto.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is a ſinfull laughter, ſpringing from ſenſuality, and exceſſe of creature contentments. Such laughter Chriſt threatens, Luk. 6. 25. <hi>Woe to you that are full, woe to you that laugh now:</hi> That is, woe to you that laugh, becauſe of your creature-fulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Laughter, which is good and commendable, hath ſuch roots, as theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it ſprings up from faith, ſuch was the laughter of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (Gen. 17. 17.) when he heard the promiſe, that he ſhould have a ſonne, the text ſaith, <hi>Abraham fell upon his face and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> That the laughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> was from faith, is cleare from the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19. affirming, that, <hi>He not being weak in faith, conſidered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadnes of</hi> Sarahs <hi>wombe, he ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbeliefe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> laughed out his faith, not (as <hi>Sarah)</hi> his unbelief. Therfore alſo Chriſt ſaith (as was toucht before) <hi>Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day, he ſaw it, and was glad:</hi> In the promiſe of his ſonne, he ſaw the <hi>Promiſed ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d,</hi> in whom all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. This ſight of the day of Chriſt, in that <hi>prospective of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> drew it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eare to the old-mans heart (though it were farre off) and made him glad.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Commendable laughter comes from holy courage,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:40455:187"/> and well grounded confidence; well temper'd magnanimity, and Chriſtian heroicalneſſe of ſpirit, lifts us ſo farre above dangers and fears, that we laugh at them.</p>
                  <p>And then, there is a laughter in dangers grounded upon aſſurance of deliverance from, or ſupport in dangers. A man that ſees a great <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ridehis ventos hoc munere te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus. &amp; imbres.</hi> Mart.</note> ſtorme coming, laughs at it, knowing where to goe to ſhelter preſently, where to get a warme houſe over his head, The Pilot knowing he hath a ſtrong Ship, and good Tackling, laughs at the windes. In that ſenſe <hi>[not to feare]</hi> is uſed <hi>(Prov.</hi> 31. 21.) where it is ſaid of the wiſe woman. <hi>She is not afraid of the ſnow for her houſhold;</hi> If the ſnow and cold weather come, ſhe doth not feare it, ſhe can laugh at the ſnow; Why? <hi>For all her houſhold are cloathed with ſcarlet, or double cloth,</hi> ſhe hath made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt cold weather, that ſhe feares neither froſt nor ſnow.</p>
                  <p>Now, the text, (when it is ſaid, <hi>At famine thou ſhalt laugh,)</hi> is not meant of laughter, ſpringing either from unbeliefe, or pride or ſelf-confidence, or ſenſuality or ſenſleſneſſe; as if he ſhould not care what God did in the world, let God doe what he would, he would laugh. As that proud Emperour ſaid (not only as one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">

No tongue can tell what it is to be more then a conquerour; when Chriſt would advance the exceeding greatneſſe of that reward, which <hi>Givers</hi> ſhall receive, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 38. He ſaith not barely, <hi>Give, and it ſhall be given you good meaſure;</hi> but you ſhall have it <hi>preſſed down,</hi> and yet more, <hi>ſhaken together;</hi> that is not all neither, but you ſhall have it <hi>running over.</hi> Now a meaſure will runne over, as long as you will poure, there is no ſtint, no bounds to that gift, which ſhall be given running over; A veſſell will run over con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, poure as long as you will: So here, you ſhall not onely have a conqueſt, but more then a conqueſt, and what that is, is as much and more than all our thoughts are able to comprehend. Hence alſo the Apoſtle ſpeaking of that great enemy, the laſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>Death</hi> (1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15. 55.) brings in the believing ſoule in a kinde of holy triumph, laughing at, and even jearing death, in the ſence of the Text, <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi> As if a man having diſarmed his enemy, ſhould ſay, now Sir, where's your ſword? where's your piſtoll? <hi>Chriſt hath diſarmed death,</hi> taken away its ſting; now the believer may laugh in the face of death, <hi>Oh death, thou thoughteſt to make us all ſmart, where is thy ſting? thou thoughteſt thy ſelfe a conquerour, able to devoure</hi>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:40455:188"/> 
                     <hi>and ſubdue us all, but where is thy victory?</hi> Such is the laughter here meant. And in the ſame ſenſe, Leviathan the mightieſt of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, that ſea monſter <hi>(to whom upon the earth there is not the like, he is made without fear,</hi> Chap. 41. 33.) is ſaid to <hi>laugh at the ſhaking of the speare</hi> (Job 41. 29.) He is ſo armed with impenitrable ſcales, that, ſhake a ſpeare at him, he laughs at you; it is an alluſion to thoſe, that are armed with <hi>proofe,</hi> they feare neither ſword nor ſhot: The truth is, a beleever is ſhot-free, ſhake the ſpeare at him, ſhake famine, ſhake deſtruction at him, threaten him with this or with that, he laughs at all, becauſe he hath <hi>armour of proofe,</hi> wherein he may ſafely truſt; He hath a ſhield, a ſhield of faith, which will quench even the fiery darts of Satan, much more then the fiery dangers of the world.</p>
                  <p>The Hiſtories of the Primitive Church, are full of this holy laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and heroicall magnanimity of the Saints, grapling with the greateſt evils. How did thoſe renowned Martyrs, even <hi>baffle death,</hi> and deride their torments (from this principle of faith in Chriſt) conquering them, not ſlighting them (from a principle of ſelfe-neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) When <hi>Polycarpe</hi> was threatned to be torne in peeces with the teeth of wild beaſts, <hi>let them come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and grind me, I ſhall make very good bread,</hi> ſo that the very tormentors were more tormented with the holy ſcorne and laughter of ſuffering Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, than the Chriſtians were with the torments which they ſuffered. In 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 14. When <hi>Abner and Joab,</hi> the two <hi>great Generals</hi> met, <hi>Abner</hi> ſaith unto <hi>Joab, Let the young men ariſe and play before us;</hi> the ſport was to fight, and fighting unto death, and yet theſe ſtout Souldiers being above feare, call it playing one with another; It is the word here in the text <hi>(let them come and laugh together before us)</hi> As if theſe young men were of ſuch courage, that they could laugh at death, and goe to killing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as if they were to goe to play with one another. Surely there is little reaſon for ſuch courage; <hi>killing of men is no laughing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no matter of sport;</hi> for, as <hi>Abner</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Joab,</hi> not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>(verſ.</hi> 26.) <hi>ſhall the ſword devoure for ever, knowest thou not, that it will be bitternſſe in the end? There is little cauſe to account the beginning of that a ſport, which will be bitterneſſe in the end:</hi> But when the Saints are to joyne in the deadlieſt battell, or to meet with the <hi>deadlieſt death for Chriſt,</hi> or from the chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hand of Chriſt, they have reaſon enough to account it a ſport, and to laugh at deſtruction (in this ſenſe cleared) becauſe they
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:40455:189"/> know it will be ſweetneſſe and comfort in the end: <hi>Valour ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times laughs at danger, much more may faith,</hi> (Pſal. 68. 12, 13.) <hi>Though ye have lyen among the pots, yet ſhall we be as the wings of a dove covered with ſilver, and her feathers with yellow gold:</hi> This is the confidence of the Saints, when they lye among the pots, or among the pot-ranges (as ſome interpret it) where the ſcullions lye, and are beſooted and black'd over, at the fire of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions till they looke like very ſcullions, that yet, they ſhall be gilded over ſoone after. Or it may be underſtood of the bounds and limits of the enemies Country: and ſo it is a deſcription of great danger, for they who lye upon the borders of an enemies Country, are in continuall feare of an aſſault; This the Greeke ſeemes to favour, rendring it thus; Though we have <hi>laine between the inheritances, or the lots, ſc.</hi> our own and the enemies; either <note place="margin">

                     <hi>The rout or crue of the Cane,</hi> that is, men that beare reeds, or canes, whereof ſpeares and arrowes were wont to be made; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the company of ſpeare-men or archers, are called a company with reeds: The word by us rendred company, is, <hi>the beaſts of the reeds,</hi> thoſe men that are like beaſts, ſavage, cruell and bloody, theſe are as bruits and beaſts of the earth; ſo they are deſcipher'd in the next verſe, <hi>The multitude of the buls, with the calves of the people.</hi> And we find the word ſignifying, a company of wicked ones, and a company of Saints in the ſame verſe <hi>Pſ.</hi> 74. 19. <hi>O deliver not the ſoule of thy turtle dove unto the multitude of the wicked;</hi> The Hebrew is unto the company of the beaſts; <hi>Forget not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> (or the beaſts) <hi>of thy poore for ever;</hi> there the ſame
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40455:190"/> word is taken (as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 10) for a company of Saints, or the poor people of God. In the Scripture of the new Teſtament, it is frequent to ſhadow wicked men under the names of beaſts, beaſts of the earth: ſo that of <hi>Paul</hi> hath been taken (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32.) <hi>If I have fought with beaſts at Epheſus after the manner of men,</hi> with beaſtly men, cruell men, men like unto beaſts in their qualities and diſpoſitions: though others underſtand it of his being caſt unto the beaſts, to fight with them, which was a cruelty thoſe perſecuting times exerciſed againſt the Chriſtians. So (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16.) <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion: Nero</hi> that cruell tyrant, is ſuppoſed to be the Lion, the beaſt of the earth he aimeth at. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. gives this <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of the <hi>Cretians,</hi> they are <hi>evill beaſts.</hi> If we take it here in this ſence, it is a truth, and a very comfortable truth, that godly men ſhall be delivered from the fear of beaſtly and cruell men, or as the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>unreaſonable or abſurd men; who have not faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But rather underſtand here <hi>beaſts of the earth</hi> properly, for thoſe fierce and cruell creatures hurtfull to man. Once man had power and dominion over all the creatures; the wildeſt beaſts were tame to him in his ſtate of innocency; till he roſe up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt God, the creatures were ſubject unto him; but man rebelling againſt God, the creatures rebelled againſt man: hence it is, that man naturally is ſurpriſed with fear at the approach and ſight of ſtrong and cruell beaſts; and therefore it is here ſpoken as a ſpeciall mercy and priviledge of the godly, that they <hi>ſhall not be afraid of the beaſts of the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The beaſt of the earth are hurtfull to us three ways;</p>
                  <p>Firſt naturally, many beaſts by nature are very dreadfull to man, as the Lion, the Bear, the Wolfe, and ſuch other fierce, ſtrong and bloody beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Scondly, Tame beaſts, ſuch as we daily uſe and ſubdue to our ſervice, are often by accident hurtful to us; The Horſe and the Ox, have many times been deſtructive to their owners.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (which I conceive is the thing chiefly aimed at here) beaſts hurt judicially, in a way of wrath from God; There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places in the book of God, wherein God threatens to arme the creatures, againſt thoſe who ſin againſt him, and that when his people ſhould forget their duties, the beaſts ſhould forget their ſubjection. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 24. <hi>I will ſend the teeth of beaſts upon them.</hi>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:40455:191"/> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 3. <hi>I will appoint over them foure kinds, ſaith the Lord, the ſword to ſlay, and the dogs to teare, and the fowles of the heaven, and the beaſts of the earth, to devoure and destroy.</hi> You ſee God can have an army any where if he pleaſeth, an army of dogs to deſtroy, an army of fowles of the aire, an army of the beaſts of the earth, to ſubdue a rebellious people. And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 21. This is one of the four ſore judgements that God denounceth againſt <hi>Jeruſalem, The ſword, and the famine, and noyſome beaſts, and the peſtilence.</hi> Thus in a judiciall manner they were very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and dreadfull, and ſo were numbred among the ſoreſt evills or judgements which God ſent upon a Nation, for their wickedneſſe. To all or any of theſe wayes, this promiſe may be inlarged. Thou ſhalt not be afraid of the naturall cruelty, the caſuall hurtfulneſſe, or the judiciary rage of beaſts, when ſent by God with commiſſion to puniſh the beaſtlineſſe of men.</p>
                  <p>How this cometh to paſſe, that beaſts of the earth hurt not godly men, is ſaid down in the next verſe, which I ſhall a while open, and then give you ſome Notes and Obſervations from both together.</p>
                  <q>Verſ 23. <hi>For thou ſhalt be in league with the ſtones of the field, and the beaſts of the field ſhall be at peace with thee.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>This verſe containes the reaſon, why he ſhould not be afraid of the beaſts of the field; and here is ſomewhat more got into the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than was before in the promiſe; the ground of the promiſe is higher, and carried farther than the promiſe it ſelfe. The promiſe was, to be delivered from the fear of beaſts; and that thou mayeſt be certaine of it, know God will not ſuffer ſo much as a ſtone to do thee hurt; <hi>thou ſhalt be at league</hi> not onely with the beaſts of the earth, but with the ſtones of the field.</p>

                  <p>A league or covenant is a very ſolemne act, an act of reaſon and of the higheſt reaſon, an act of judgement and deepeſt deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore it may be doubted how a league can be entred with ſtones, which have no life, or with beaſts which have no reaſon. We read <hi>(Gen.</hi> 31. 41.) of a league or covenant made at or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an heap of ſtones, between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban;</hi> but this is
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40455:191"/> very ſtrange and unheard of, to make a league with a heape of ſtones.</p>
                  <p>For the claring of this, we muſt enquire into two things;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What theſe ſtones are.</item>
                     <item>2. What this league with ſtones doth import.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, For the Stones: There are divers opinions about them, and many Interpreters have exceedingly ſtumbled at theſe ſtones: Some change theſe ſtones into men, ſtrong men, or the ſtrongeſt of men. That of <hi>Job</hi> in the next Chapter, hath ſome alluſion to it, ver. 12. <hi>Is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones?</hi> A ſtrong man is ſtrong, as a ſtone.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt, underſtands by ſtones, the Law, which was written in ſtones. Thou ſhalt be in league with the ſtones,</hi> that is, the Law written in <hi>tables of ſtone</hi> ſhall never hurt thee. But that (as to this text) is a meare conceit, though (in it ſelfe) a great truth, and our greateſt comfort, that believers are at league with thoſe <hi>Law-ſtones,</hi> which left in power and hoſtility, would have broken all man-kind to pieces, and ground them to power. Chriſt hath made peace for us with the Law; The Law had a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell at us, and the Law would have been upon us with an everlaſting war, if Chriſt had not ſetled our peace by ſatisfying the Law; <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to death, had been the death of us all, if Chriſt had not made a league for us with theſe ſtones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others interpret theſe ſtones by a Metanomy of the continent for the thing contained, <hi>Thou ſhalt be at league with the ſtones of the field,</hi> with the rocks or rocky places, that is, thou ſhalt be at league with thoſe creatures, or with thoſe beaſts, which lie among the ſtones, and have their dens about hollow rocks: and ſo they make the latter branch <hi>[and the beaſts of the field ſhall be at peace with thee]</hi> to be exegeticall, giving us the expoſition of the former, or ſhewing what is meant by being at league with the ſtones of the field; <hi>Thou ſhalt be at league with the ſtones of the field,</hi> that is, with the beaſts who make their dens, and their holes, and their hiding places anomg the ſtones of the field. This is a good ſence of the words.</p>
                  <p>But leaving the former, with ſome other apprehenſions about theſe ſtones, I ſhall take theſe ſtones properly, and ſo they will fall under foure conſiderations, all which give light to the clearing of this text, and the manner of our league with ſtones.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As naturally ſcattered upon the face of the earth, ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40455:192"/> travellers, or endangering a man in haſt upon his way. One part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> was called <hi>Arabia Petraea,</hi> or the ſtony, becauſe it was full of ſtones, and ſo uneaſie either for tillage or travell.</p>
                  <p>Stones are ſo dangerous to the foot, that the Latine word is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>hurting the foot;</hi> Hence thoſe Scripture-expreſſions, <note place="margin">Lapis à laedendo pede nomen ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</note> 
                     <hi>A ſtumbling ſtone, and a rock of offence,</hi> becauſe men are ſo apt to ſtumble at ſtones. And both theſe are applyed to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a figure, he is called <hi>A ſtumbling ſtone, and a rock of offence. Chriſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is the moſt precious and elect foundation-ſtone to build on, but he is the moſt ſore and dangerous ſtone to ſtumble on: To be in league and covenant with that living ſtone, is the higheſt mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe ſtones as they lie naturally hidden in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of the earth, or under the earth, are a trouble to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in tilling the ground, in plowing and ſowing, and they often endanger the breaking of his plow, and hinder the rooting and growth of the ſeed ſowne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider theſe ſtones as artificially laid together for the making of a wall or mound to fence and part field from field, or both from the common fields and high-ways.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider theſe ſtones as artificially and induſtriouſly placed for <hi>marks</hi> and <hi>boundaries,</hi> to diſtinguiſh private mens lands, or the precincts of ſuch and ſuch countries, which are commonly called <note n="a" place="margin">Lapides ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minales.</note> 
                     <hi>Mark ſtones,</hi> or <hi>Boundary-ſtones;</hi> as alſo ſtones ſet in roads or high-ways, for the direction of Travellers, pointing which way to goe to eminent Towns or Cities. Of ſuch a ſtone we read (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 19.) when <hi>Jonathan</hi> bad <hi>David</hi> ſtay at the ſtone <hi>Eziel,</hi> that is, as we put in the <hi>Margin</hi> of our Bibles, the <hi>ſtone that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way,</hi> or <hi>the</hi>

                  <p>Now conſider the other terme, what it is to be in league with ſtones, in any of, or in all theſe acceptations.</p>
                  <p>In generall we know, that to be <hi>in league with ſtones,</hi> is an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:40455:192"/> or alluſive ſpeech: <hi>Stones</hi> are not capable of the formalities of a <hi>league,</hi> when we are in <hi>league</hi> or <hi>covenant</hi> with God or man, ſo with ſtones; theſe two things are made out to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God or man will do us no hurt; A covenant or league takes off the actings of hoſtility. Whatſoever a man is in covenant with, he fears no damage from. <hi>Preſumptuous ſinners having made a covenant with hell, and an agreement with death, build their confidence of indemnity upon the ſtrength of it. When the over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcourge ſhall paſſe through, it ſhall not come neare us,</hi> Iſa. 28. 15. A man that is in league with the devill, believes the devill will doe him no wrong.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A <hi>league</hi> imports, that we may expect to receive good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, benefits and bleſſings either from God or man, according to the Articles of covenant agreed to, and ſealed reſpectively. Theſe two aſſurances we have by a <hi>league.</hi> And when it is ſaid here, that a godly man is in <hi>league with the ſtones of the field,</hi> both theſe are to be underſtood. It is as much as to ſay, <hi>The ſtones of the field ſhall not annoy him;</hi> yea, <hi>the ſtones of the field ſhall be a benefit or a friend to him.</hi> Man is ſaid to be in <hi>league with ſtones,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the effect of a <hi>league from ſtones.</hi> Taking it in this generall ſence, we may apply it unto thoſe four particular ſences of ſenſeleſs ſtones before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As ſtones are naturally ſcattered upon the face of the earth, the promiſe imports thus much; that ſuch ſtones ſhall not hurt or annoy him in his walks or travells. This promiſe we have expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 91. 11.) <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy wayes, they ſhall beare thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> This is the <hi>league with ſtones,</hi> Stones ſhall not annoy thee in thy way, thou ſhalt not ſtumble or fall to break thy bones, or bruiſe thy body upon theſe ſtones. The devill in his combat with Chriſt, miſapplyeth this promiſe of a <hi>league with the ſtones</hi> (Mat. 4. 6.) Tempting him to caſt himſelfe down from a pinacle of the Temple, for it is written, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leaſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone;</hi> As if he had ſaid, a godly man hath this aſſurance from his league with the ſtones, that he ſhal receive no harm from them, therefore truſt God, and in confidence of this promiſe, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> So here is the firſt ſence, <hi>Thou ſhalt be at league with the ſtones of the field;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt not be hurt by thoſe <hi>ſtones,</hi> as thou travelleſt or walkeſt.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:40455:193"/>
                  <p> Secondly, Take the ſtones as they lie hidden in the earth, then to be at league with them, hath this ſence. Firſt, that in tilling the earth, ſtones ſhould not trouble or hinder that work. God ſhall ſo order it, that though thou ploweſt among ſtones, yet thou ſhalt till thy ground ſucceſſefully. The ſtony ground ſhall be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ground. In that Parable of a vineyard <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 5. 1) God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to manifeſt his care of making it fruitfull, by this act among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>I gathered out the ſtones thereof,</hi> ver. 2, noting that ſtones are naturally great impediments to fruitfulneſſe. We rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>(Mat.</hi> 13. 5.) how the ſeed, which fell upon the <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> ſprung up quickly and withered as quickly; Stony ground naturally cannot feed or bring forth fruit to maturity. It is then a great priviledge, thus to be in <hi>league with the ſtones of the field,</hi> that though we ſow among ſtones, yet we ſhall have a plentifull <hi>Harveſt.</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> deſcribed the days of his proſperity (Chap. 29. 6) he ſaith, <hi>The Rocke powred him out rivers of oyle:</hi> To have oyle out of rocks, is like having corne out of the ſtones, both noting things ſucceeding <note place="margin">Juſto molleſcu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſaxa, im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> would ſhew how God can work beyond all the poſſibilities of nature or reaſon, he ſaith to the Jewes, <hi>Even of theſe ſtones God can raiſe up children unto Abraham,</hi> (Mat. 3.) There is ſomewhat of a miracle in it, to raiſe up bread to a man out of ſtones; that is, to make rocky land, a fertile ſoile. God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his people, that he would make the earth to be iron under them; that is, the earth which was ordinarily fruitfull, ſhall yield you no more fruit, then iron; And on the other ſide he promiſes, <hi>That they ſhall ſuck honey out of the rocke, and oyle out of the flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rocke,</hi> Deut. 32. 13. <hi>Honey out of the rock;</hi> That is, honey of Bees, hiving themſelves in rocks; or (as others) honey fruits, as Dates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which grow on Palme trees (as oyle on Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees) in rocky places.

                     </note> plenty; For whereas rocks and ſtones are uſually barren, he would make thoſe places fruitfull to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> They ſhould have oyle out of the rock in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as well as water out of a rock in the wilderneſſe. We are ſurely in league with thoſe rocks and ſtones of the fields, which ſend us ſuch <hi>Preſents</hi> as theſe, bread and water, honey and oyle.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Take theſe <hi>Stones,</hi> as artificially laid together, and ſo, <note place="margin">Nunquam diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvetur mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, non diſſiliet lapis ex ſepe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo furabitur, ne no Inſiliet in agros tuos.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt be in league with them,</hi> is thus to be underſtood, Thoſe walls and mounds of ſtone, ſhall be as the keepers and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

When God would ſhew his intendment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and lay waſte his vineyard; he expreſſes it by pulling down the wall, as before he had expreſs'd his care to protect it, by buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a wall, Iſa. 5. 2. <hi>I fenced it, and gathered out the ſtones thereof;</hi> which we may underſtand thus, <hi>I gatherd out the ſtones</hi> (and as it is uſuall) <hi>made a fence of them;</hi> and had the vineyard brought forth fruit, it had alſo been in league with theſe ſtones, that is, the ſtones of the wall had kept out the wild-beaſts, or any annoyance from them; but being fruitleſſe, the league with thoſe ſtones was broken: <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord, ver. 5.) <hi>will breake downe the wall thereof, and it ſhall be troden downe.</hi> So that, in this ſenſe, to be <hi>at league with the ſtones of the field,</hi> is as much as to ſay, the <hi>ſtone-wall</hi> or the <hi>ſtone-fence</hi> which is made about thy field, ſhall ſtand to protect and maintain thy land, thy fruits and cattell, from the incurſions of wild beaſts, from ſpoyling and treading down <note place="margin">

                     <hi>with the ſtones of the field,</hi> is a promiſe of keeping our inheritances free from invaſion and confuſion, that we ſhall know what is ours, and that no enemy ſhall take it from us.</p>
                  <p>It was a great ſin to remove the <hi>land-marks</hi> and <hi>boundaries,</hi> and a great puniſhment was threatned againſt any, who ſhould alter or remove them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 17. And when the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> would ſhew, how extreamly wicked the Princes of <hi>Judah</hi> were, he ſaith (Chap. 5. 10.) <hi>The Princes of Judah were like them that remove the bounds;</hi> as if he had ſaid, we account thoſe the worſt of men, who remove land-marks; how vile then are theſe Princes, who are as bad as they. Juſt as the wickedneſſe of the people is aggravated, Chap. 4. 4. <hi>This people are as they that ſtrive with the Priefl.</hi> To ſtrive with the Prieſt, is to ſtrive with God, that's a ſad ſtrife. Strivers with the Priſt are the worſt of people, how vile then are this people, who are as bad as they. But to the preſent poynt, if it be ſo great a ſin to remove the <hi>land-ſtones,</hi> it muſt needs be a great mercy to have thoſe ſtones preſerved. So then, to <hi>be in league with the ſtones of the field,</hi> may have this good ſence alſo, the <hi>boundary-ſtones</hi> ſhall be preſerved, none ſhall remove them, and they ſhall preſerve thy eſtate, that none ſhall invade or waſt it.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God can doe us good by any thing, if he pleaſeth, and nothing can doe us good without God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though we have carefully ſet up bounds, though we have made ſtrong fences, yet theſe will not keep out evill or annoyance, unleſs there be a league, a league of Gods making for us; And God can produce our comforts out of improbables, yea impoſſibles to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: He can fetch us bread and a bleſſing from ſtones. It was a temptation upon Chriſt, when he was hungry <hi>to make bread of ſtones. If thou be the ſon of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread.</hi> Mat. 4. 2. But it is our comfort, that God can turn ſtones into bread, that he can make thoſe things which are moſt improbable to do us good, very good unto us. It is a ſin for us to turne ſtones into bread, or to expect ſtones to be turned into bread, that is, to put God upon miracles from us, when means or indeavours may help us; but God out of the ſuperaboundance of his power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, alwayes can, and ſometimes will work miracles, turning ſtones into bread for us. Then, we turne ſtones into bread, when we live upon ſin, whoſoever eateth a bit of bread, out
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:40455:194"/> of bread out of the hand of ſin, turneth ſtones into bread. Then, God turnes ſtones into bread for us, when out of his infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and goodneſſe, he gives us ſupplies by unuſall meanes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts us by that, from which, we can expect no more comfort, then we doe bread and water out of ſtones.</p>
                  <p>Further, when ſtones ſeeme to be moſt angry with a godly man, then he is in league with them. Stones (in a proper ſenſe) flew about the eares of <hi>Steven,</hi> and kil'd him, yet <hi>Steven</hi> was in league with the ſtones, even while they took away his life: God turned theſe ſtones into bread for him: and every ſtone, was as a glorious Diamond in his Crown of Martyrdome.</p>

Idem ex</hi> Vlpiano.</note> The former is grounded upon a cuſtome in <hi>Arabia,</hi> where, or neare which it is ſuppoſed <hi>Jobs</hi> friends dwelt It was (ſaith the learned Authour) a very capitall offence in that country, if any man did caſt or carry heapes of ſtones into his neighbours ground; For that action had this ſignification or meaning in it, The man, who afterwards ventured to plow or till that ground, ſhould ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye by the hands of thoſe, who caſt in thoſe ſtones. So that, the ſight of ſuch ſtones was terrible and ominous to the owner of the Land, as ſpeaking death and ruine to him, if he medled with it. Hence t'was often left unus'd and untill'd. Againſt this barbarous cuſtome (it being an occaſion of murders and blood ſhed) a very ſevere Law was made; <hi>That whoſoever ſhould be diſcovered to have caſt ſuch Stones into his neighbours ground, ſhould have judgment of death by the Magiſtrate.</hi> In alluſion to this Law or cuſtome, the interpretation of this promiſe <hi>(Thou ſhalt be in league with the ſtones of the field)</hi> is made out thus. The ordinary Stones of the field ſhall be ſo farre from hurting, that, even thoſe Stones, which ſpeake anger and malice ſhall not hurt thee. God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile or ſubdue the rage of thine enemies, and though they have caſt theſe Stones of defiance into thy Land, yet they ſhall deſire a league of peace with thee, or fall before thee.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is grounded upon a cuſtome, in warre; of which we reade (2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 3. 25.) that, when the <hi>Moabites</hi> fled before <hi>Iſrael, The purſuing Iſraelites beat down their Cityes, and on every good peece of Land, caſt every man his Stone, and filled it. &amp;c. Eliphaz</hi> might have an eye to this, as if he had ſaid, Thy land ſhall not be buried under the heapes of ſtones, thrown there by a conquering
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:40455:195"/> hand; that is, thou ſhalt have a league of amity with, or victory over all that are round about thee.</p>
                  <q>And the Beaſts of the field ſhall be at peace with thee.</q>
                  <p>That is, they ſhall (through the power of God) be made peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thee. <hi>To be at peace with the Beaſts,</hi> is the ſame in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with <hi>being in league with Stones.</hi> It was mans priviledge by creation to have power over the Beaſts of the field, and it is the priviledge of Redemption, <hi>To be at peace with them.</hi> This is the ordinary priviledge of every Believer. But there is a more tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent priviledge of the Church, in the moſt flouriſhing eſtate of it here on the earth, repreſented under this notion, Iſa. 11. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>The Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid, and the Calfe, and the young Lion, and the fatling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and a little childe ſhall leade them, &amp;c. And the ſucking child ſhall play on the hole of the Aspe, and the weaned childe ſhall put his hand on the Cockatrice den; They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountaine.</hi> This <hi>Peace with Beaſts,</hi> is within a degree of glory with God, whether we underſtand it in the letter, of beaſts in kind, or in the Allegory, of men ſymbolizing in rage and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in power and poyſons, in ſtings and teeth with beaſts and Serpents.</p>
                  <p>The Text before us, goes lower then this promiſe; <hi>And to be at peace with the Beaſts of the field,</hi> is, only a gracious aſſurance that they ſhall not hurt us, or that they ſhall be uſefull to us. In the firmneſſe of this promiſe of <hi>peace with the Beaſts,</hi> the fearleſneſſe of a godly man is founded, <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of the Beaſts of the earth, for the Beaſts of the earth ſhall be at peace with him.</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The courage and fearleſneſſe of a godly man, is grounded in divine reaſon, not on humane preſumption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we ſee a man ſtout in the midſt of danger, fearles amongſt wild beaſts, we may wonder where the ſpring of this courage lies: This promiſe ſheweth you the ſpring-head, <hi>He is at peace with them;</hi> It is not conceit and fancy, or deſperateneſſe of ſpirit, that cauſeth him to deride and ſlight danger; but he hath a ſolid ground there is a peace and league ratified in heaven, for him even with the Stones and Beaſts of the earth. As a godly man can give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the hope that is in him; ſo he can give a reaſon of the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that is in him; he knowes why he is ſo ſtout and venturous.</p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:40455:195"/>
                  <p> Secondly, Obſerve from both, in that man is here ſaid to be in league with the ſtones, and at peace with the Beaſts; That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every creature by ſin is made dangerous and hurtfull unto man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, in that there is a league and peace made with theſe, it notes, that they were in a ſtate of hoſtility, ready to riſe up againſt us and annoy us. As the creature by reaſon of mans ſin is ſubject unto va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſo man is ſubject unto feare, by reaſon of the creature. <hi>Sin hath made the creature vanitie in it ſelfe, and ſinne hath made the creature vexation unto us.</hi> When the Beaſts rebell againſt us, we ſhould remember how we have rebelled againſt God, And, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till God renewes a league, and makes peace for us with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there is not a creature upon the earth, but may quickly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to us. If God ſpeakes the word, and gives a call or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a fly, againſt the ſtrongeſt, the ſwifteſt man; flight ſhall periſh from the ſwift, and power from the ſtrong, neither of them ſhall eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thou ſhalt be in league with the Stones, and with the Beaſts;</hi> he reckons up all thoſe wayes, by which evills may come in upon us. And aſſures a man, to whom God is reconciled, that theſe evills ſhall not come. Hence obſerve; That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When God is once a friend to us, he can quickly make all other things friendly to us alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every godly man (of ſuch <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here ſpeaks) is at peace and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Qui Dominum habet adjutore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, habebit &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes creaturas adjutrices, ille ſi favet, favent omnes: ait, aiunt: negat, negant: Qui Dominum ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet cuſtode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebit &amp; lapides campi cuſtodes.</hi> Brent. <hi>in loc. Tranquillus Deus, Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat omnia.</hi>
                     </note> in league with God, therefore God makes all creatures at peace and league with him. Though uſually, they who are in neareſt league and covenant with God, are moſt warred with, and oppoſed by the world, yet this ſtands ſure, that when God is our friend, he can make our enemies our friends, or their enmity ſhall be-friend us; Stones and ſavage beaſts ſhall be helpfull to us. <hi>When God is at peace with us, he makes all things at peace with us. Daniel</hi> was at peace with God, and he was at peace among the Lions. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8.) gives it in generall, <hi>If God be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> No creature hath power in it ſelfe to maintaine warre and emnity againſt thoſe, on whoſe ſide God appeares. If God loves us, <hi>All things worke together for good to us.</hi> He that hath helpe from God, ſhall not want helpe from any creature; for all creatures are at the call and command of God; If he ſaith, <hi>go, they muſt goe; if he ſaith, come, they muſt come; if he ſaith to a ſtone doe ſuch a man good, the Stone muſt doe it; if he ſaith to a Raven, goe carry</hi> Elijah <hi>his dinner, the Raven will haſten; if he ſaith to</hi>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:40455:196"/> 
                     <hi>a wild Beaſt, ſave ſuch a man, deliver ſuch a man, ſpare ſuch a man, he muſt goe of Gods errand.</hi> In our friendſhip and league with God, we have a vertuall league of friendſhip with the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly creatures.</p>
                  <p>And if God pleaſe, he can make men, who have as little ſenſe as Stones, and leſſe reaſon than Beaſts; to be helpfull and uſefull, and peaceable to his people. There is a generation amongſt us, a ſtony generation, a hard-hearted generation of men, you may as well move a ſtone, as move them with what you ſay; a beaſtly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men, when you deale with them, you deale with Beaſts; yet the great God, (if he pleaſe) can make a league for us with theſe ſtones, he can make theſe Beaſts of the earth, brutiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable men, <hi>To be at peace with us,</hi> Further obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is from ſpeciall providence, that the Stones, and the Beaſts of the earth doe not hurt nor deſtroy us, but ſpecially that they helpe and doe us good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is providence towards all, but a ſpeciall providence to the people of God, that the creatures hurt them not. If God did not bridle the rage and reſtraine the power of Beaſts, man could not comfortably ſubſiſt with them. The reaſon is given <hi>(Deut.</hi> 7. 22.) why God deſtroyed the <hi>Canaanites</hi> by little and little, before his people, namely, <hi>Leaſt the Beaſts of the earth ſhould increaſe upon them.</hi> Here was a ſpeciall providence, as all leagues, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makings are. All the leagues and peace which beleevers have, are branches of that <hi>great league,</hi> of that <hi>grand Covenant,</hi> which God hath made with Chriſt on our behalfe. And therefore <hi>(Hoſ.</hi> 2. 18.) this promiſe is made in ſpeciall to the Church. <hi>And in that day I will make a Covenant for them, with the Beaſts of the field.</hi> Fifthly, note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A godly man enjoyes common comforts from ſpeciall favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wicked men are ſeldome hurt by the beaſts of the field but they are never at peace with them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peace is a great mercy. By how much God makes more peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, by ſo much, man hath more of Heaven upon Earth. Man ſhould deſire peace with Beasts, much more with men, moſt of all with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </gap> by way of application brought home to <hi>Job,</hi> in the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or laſt verſe of the Chapter.</p>
                  <q>Verſ. 24. <hi>And thou ſhalt know that thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt know it.]</hi> Knowledge is ſometime put for preſent ſenſe; <hi>He that keepes the commandement, ſhall feel</hi> (Heb. ſhall know) <hi>no evill:</hi> and ſo, <hi>Job</hi> is promiſed to know, his Tabernacle ſhall be in peace, that is, he ſhall ſee and feele it to be in peace. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Knowledge is put for experience; As we ſay of a rich man, <hi>he never knew poverty;</hi> And in that ſenſe, <hi>Chriſt is ſaid not to have knowne ſin,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. Thus, alſo, the godly man knows his Tabernacle ſhall have peace, even by the peace which he hath had; From the former dealings of God, he gathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, what God will do with him, for the time to come; Thou ſhalt not find me a falſe Prophet, or that I have fed thee with wind: <hi>Thou ſhalt know from experience,</hi> that thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace.</p>
                  <p>And there is a third way by which this might be knowne, <hi>ſc.</hi> by debate and reaſoning: <hi>Thou ſhalt know it;</hi> If thou doeſt
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:40455:197"/> but conſider, what the eſtate of a godly man is, and what God hath ſpoken about that eſtate, thou mayeſt make out ſuch a concluſion, that certainly thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace.</p>
                  <p>There is a fourth way of knowing, and that is, upon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or word of another, this is properly called <hi>Faith: Thou ſhalt know it,</hi> that is, by looking into the word of God, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the promiſes made to godly men, thou ſhalt aſſent to and beleeve this thing, that <hi>thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, To know, is as much as to be aſſured, or certaine of a thing; And to know ſo, is oppoſed not only to ignorance and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but it is oppoſed to the lower degrees of faith; <hi>I know that my Redeemer lives, &amp;c,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi> Chap. 19. 25.) that is, I am ſure he lives. And the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Knowing that he which raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe us up alſo by Jeſus.</hi> Knowledge is often put for aſſurance, and it may riſe to that pitch here, <hi>Thou ſhalt be aſſured that thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy Tabernacle.]</hi> Tabernacles were of two ſorts. There were Tabernacles for civill uſes, and <hi>the Tabernacle</hi> for church uſes. They dwelt in Tabernacles, and God was worſhipped in a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, And therefore <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 23. 4.) <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> are called <hi>Aholah and Aholibah. Iſrael,</hi> the ten Tribes, is called <hi>Aholah,</hi> that is, <hi>a Tent,</hi> or <hi>a Tabernacle,</hi> noting, that they had been the Tent and the Tabernacle of God, wherein he was worſhipped; But <hi>Judah</hi> is called <hi>Aholibah,</hi> that is, <hi>my Tent is in the middeſt of her,</hi> becauſe God at that time continued the outward Ordinances of his worſhip to <hi>Judah,</hi> though the ten Tribes had been long in captivity. That only by the way. Here by Tabernacles we are to underſtand civill Tabernacles, for in thoſe Eaſterne Countries their ordinary habitations and dwellings were in moveable Tents or Tabernacles, becauſe of their frequent removes. And hence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward amongſt the Latines, the word for a Tent or Tabernacle, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified a houſe, or any place wherein men dwell and frequent. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a Trope, a Tabernacle ſignifies all a mans eſtate, or all his goods; ſo that, when it is ſaid, <hi>thy Tabernacle ſhall be in peace,</hi> the meaning is, thy whole eſtate and family, what ever thou haſt, <hi>ſhall be in peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall be in peace.]</hi> That is, it ſhall be peaceable or in ſafety; <note place="margin">Solent frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimè abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta ob Emphaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in pro concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis praedicari.</note> Peace may be conſidered two wayes; either ſtrictly or largely: Strictly, and ſo peace is oppoſed to warre; either firſt, forreigne, or ſecondly, civill, or thirdly, domeſticall warre (as we may call
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:40455:197"/> it) namely ſtrife and contention in families. Thus, <hi>Thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle ſhall be in peace,</hi> may take in all theſe; thou ſhalt neither be invaded by forreigners, neither ſhalt thou have any inſurrection and ſedition in thy own borders; neither ſhalt thou have unkind contentions, in thy particular family, or within thy private walls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take the word more largely (as it is very frequently in Scripture) and then peace ſignifies all manner of bleſſings and good things, the confluence and gathering together as it were, of all comforts: And peace in this large ſenſe, is oppoſed to any kind of trouble or adverſity; and to ſay ſuch an one hath peace, is as much as to ſay, he proſpers. Peace and proſperity are termes of the ſame ſignification: And then the meaning is this, <hi>Thou ſhalt know that thy Tabernacle ſhall be in Peace,</hi> that is, that thy whole eſtate ſhall proſper, and that thou ſhalt have good ſucceſſe. Note hence Firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peace is a choice and a ſpeciall bleſſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Outward peace is the choiceſt of outward bleſſings, and inward peace is the choiceſt of ſpirituall bleſſings. Peace gives ſweetneſſe and beauty to all our bleſſings: without peace, riches are but guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thornes; honour is but higher miſery; health but ſtronger affliction.</p>
                  <p>So without inward peace, grace gives no preſent comfort; And therefore in the wiſhes of perfect ſpiritual mercy, to the Saints, we find theſe two in conjunction, <hi>Grace and Peace.</hi> The higheſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made to the church, are promiſes of ſetled peace in the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 18. <hi>My people ſhall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting places:</hi> There's the top of their outward felicity. Againe, in the the thirty third of that prophecie, ver. 20. <hi>Looke upon Zion the City of our ſolemnities</hi> (that is, where the worſhip of God was ſolemniz'd) <hi>thine eyes ſhall ſee Jeruſalem a quiet habitation; a Tabernacle that ſhall not be taken downe, not one of the ſtakes thereof ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of the cords thereof be broken;</hi> Pure Ordinances, and a peaceable habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> perfection on earth; yea ſome looke upon it as a perfection too perfect for earth, and therefore interpret the prophecie of the heavenly Jeruſalem,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſaith not only, thou ſhalt have peace in thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, <hi>but thou ſhalt know it.</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be aſſured of a mercy, is better than the enjoyment of a mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:40455:198"/>
                  <p> Doubts of looſing a mercy, eat out the heart of a mercy; and a man in that caſe, is as much troubled with the feare of wanting, as he can be comforted with the ſenſe of enjoying.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſteps of bleſſedneſſe. To be delivered from evill, is but a part of bleſſedneſſe, negative bleſſednes: To receive good, is the better part of bleſſedneſſe, poſitive bleſſedneſſe. But to be aſſured that we ſhall hold and retaine all this, is the perfection of bleſſedneſſe. The firſt part of that great bleſſing we receive by Chriſt, conſiſts in our deliverance from evill, or in a freedome from periſhing. The ſecond conſiſts in the conveyance of good to us, as pardon of ſin, grace and glory. But the third (which is the height of all) conſiſts in our everlaſting aſſurance to enjoy all this: <hi>Adam</hi> had a good eſtate, but he was not aſſured of it: The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we have by Chriſt, are built upon a foundation, which can never be ſhaken. In this method, temporall mercies are promiſed in this Scripture: Firſt, deliverance from ſword and famine. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, peace with the creatures. Thirdly, an aſſurance that this peace ſhall be continued. Laſtly obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All outward bleſſings are in themſelves fading and periſhing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though a man be aſſured that he ſhall enjoy outward bleſſings, yet he can enjoy them but in the nature and condition of outward bleſſings. Though he be ſure to uſe and enjoy them, yet he looks upon them as periſhing in the uſing. All outward things are here (as frequently in other Scriptures) implied under the notion of a Tabernacle; a Tabernacle is a moveable habitation. It is a peece of a miracle if a Tabernacle ſtand long; that promiſe <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 33. 20.) imports ſomewhat extraordinary: A Tabernacle that ſhould not be taken downe, not one of the ſtakes thereof removed, nor any of the cords thereof be broken; It is as if the holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay; Thou ſhalt be a Tabernacle priviledg'd above all Tabernacles: They are moveable, unfixed, eaſie to be taken downe; but it ſhall not be ſo with thee. The Apoſtles concluſion takes in all creature comforts, <hi>The faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 31. The ſcheme, the beauty of the beſt earthly things paſſe, while we enjoy them, and moulder away between our hands while we are uſing them.</p>
                  <q>And thou ſhalt viſit thy habitation, and ſhalt not ſin.</q>
                  <p>This clauſe of the verſe compleats mercy yet higher; It is better not to ſin in our habitation, then to be aſſured of a habitation. <hi>To</hi>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:40455:198"/> 
                     <hi>have quietneſſe in our habitation is very good, but to have holineſſe in it, is beſt of all. Thou ſhalt viſit thy habitation, and ſhalt not ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>habitation,</hi> ſignifies not only a <hi>houſe,</hi> but a <hi>wife,</hi> or a <hi>houſewife;</hi> Hence ſome render, <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi>

                     <hi>viſit thy beauty, or thy faire and beautifull wife, and ſhalt not ſin;</hi> The reaſon is, either becauſe a good wife is the beauty and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the houſe: or becauſe the knowledge, wiſedome and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the wife, is a meanes to furniſh and adorne the houſe; or laſtly, the buſineſſe of a wife is ſo much in the houſe, that ſhe ſhares names with the houſe: ſhe is, or ought to be like a ſhaile, living with her houſe upon her back. The Apoſtles rule alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I will that the younger women marry, beare children, guide the houſe,</hi> 1 Tim. 5, 14. And <hi>exhort them to be diſcreet, chaſt, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers at home,</hi> Tit. 2. 5. Hence alſo probably, the ſame word in Hebrew, ſignifies a beautifull wife, and a beautifull houſe. We reade it in that ſenſe <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 68. 12.) <hi>Kings of armies did fly apace, and ſhe that tarried at home divided the spoile.

                  <p>But here, we may rather take the word in the ordinary ſenſe, only with this emphaſis, ſignifying (not bare walls, or a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous family) but a beautifull, a well furniſhed, a well ordered houſe. And ſo we have the word, at the third verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw the wicked taking root, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently I curſed his habitation,</hi> or his goodly, beautifull, flouriſhing houſe: So here, <hi>thou ſhalt viſit thy habitation,</hi> that is, thy houſe in all the beauty, order, riches and furniture of it.</p>

Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates to this ſenſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt viſit thy habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhalt not miſprosper.</hi> And ſo <hi>Eliphaz</hi> may hint at <hi>Jobs</hi> former loſſes, at the overthrow of his eſtate and family; as if he had ſaid, heretofore thou didſt viſit thy habitation, and didſt not proſper, but if thou ſhalt now humble thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt viſit thy habitation, and all ſhall proſper, things ſhall goe well with thee, thou ſhalt not labour in vaine, or looſe thy end in the care thou takeſt about thy family.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſenſe may be this, thou ſhalt order and viſit thy family, with ſo much juſtice, equity &amp; holineſſe, that thou ſhalt not ſin. Not that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> undertakes his abſolute freedome from

                  <p>There is a further expoſition joyning both theſe together, <hi>Thou ſhalt viſit thy houſe, and ſhalt not ſin,</hi> namely, by conniving or winking at the ſins and diſorders of thy family, and yet thou ſhalt have peace: thy ſtrict and faithfull carriage in over-ſeeing thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſhall not provoke either ſervants, or children to contention and complainings, to anger and paſſion; Thy holy ſeverity ſhall not fill thy houſe with quarrels and troubles; but God ſhall ſo <note place="margin">

                     <hi>It is a great and a ſpeciall point of godly wiſdome, well to order and viſit a family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Families are the principles or ſeeds of a Common-wealth. As every man is a little world, ſo every houſe is a little King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>A family is a Common-wealth in a little volume.</hi> And the rules of it, are an epitomie of all Lawes, by which whole Nations are govern'd. The Apoſtle makes it a ſpeciall character of <hi>his Biſhop,</hi> That he muſt be <hi>one who rules his own houſe well;</hi> and ſubjoynes the reaſon, <hi>For if a man know not how to rule his own houſe, how ſhall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 4, 5. And therein wraps up this truth, that he who knowes how to rule his own houſe well, is in a good poſture of ſpirit for publike rule. The ſame wiſdome, and juſtice, and holineſſe for kind, only more enlarg'd and extenſiue, acts in either ſpheare, and will regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly move both. Secondly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A family well viſited and ordered, is uſually a proſperous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sinne ſpoiles the comforts and cankers the bleſſings of a family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sin brought into a houſe, rots the timber, and pulls down the houſe; or it undermines the foundation, and blowes up the houſe. <hi>The ſin of families, is the ruine and conſumption of families.</hi> Hence thirdly obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be kept from ſin, is a better and a greater bleſſing, than all outward bleſſings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had reckoned up all the comforts, which repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Job</hi> is promiſed; Thou ſhalt be delivered in ſix troubles and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:40455:200"/> in ſeven: Sword and famine ſhall not hurt thee, peace and plenty ſhall dwell within thy walls, and lodge in every chamber: Yet (ſaith he) I will tell thee of a bleſſing, beyond all theſe, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſin:</hi> It is more mercy to be delivered from one ſin, then from ſword and famine; grace is better then peace, and holineſſe then aboundance; riches, and honour, and health, are all obſcured in this one bleſſing, A holy, a gracious, an humble heart.</p>
                  <p>There is more evill in one ſin, than in any or all troubles; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there muſt needs be a greater bleſſing in being kept from ſin, than in protection from any or all troubles. Sin is the greateſt evill, therefore to be kept from ſin, is one of the greateſt goods. Chriſt took upon him all ſorts of outward evils, <hi>he became poor for our ſakes,</hi> he had not ſo much as an houſe to lye in: he came in the forme of a ſervant for our ſakes, and he was a man of ſorrowes, He was acquainted with grief all his life, at laſt with death and a grave; Yet, he would not admit of the leaſt ſin: he was content to bears all our ſins, but he abhord the thought of acting one. <hi>Not to ſin, is the next priviledge to God, and the utmoſt priviledge of man.</hi> When in a full ſenſe, man ſhall not ſin, man will be arrived at fulnes of joy; and as we daily empty of ſin, ſo we proportionably, fill with joy.</p>
                  <q>Verſ. 25. <hi>Thou ſhalt know alſo that thy ſeed ſhall be great, and thy off ſpring as the graſſe of the earth.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>From the preſent beſſings upon the family, he deſcends to thoſe which concerne poſterity; as if he had ſaid, thy comforts ſhall not be confined to thy ſelfe, neither ſhall they be ſhut up within the limits of one generation; Mercies ſhall be tranſmitted to thy children, thy heires ſhall inherit bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy ſeed ſhall be great.</hi> The word <hi>Great,</hi> ſignifies both multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and magnitude: Thou ſhalt have a <hi>great ſeed,</hi> that is, a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous <note place="margin">

                  <q>And thy off-ſpring as the graſſe of the earth.</q>
                  <p>Both clauſes of the verſe meane the ſame thing. The word which we tranſlate <hi>off-ſpring,</hi> ſignifies properly <hi>that which goeth forth</hi> or iſſues, becauſe children ſpring or goe forth from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <note place="margin">

                  <q>Thy off-ſpring ſhall be as the graſſe of the earth.</q>

                  <p>Man kind in generall is compared unto graſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 6. <hi>All fleſh is graſſe;</hi> Graſſe in regard of its ſudden withering, he is ſuddenly cut downe, <hi>the goodlineſſe of man is as the flower of the field.</hi> Wicked men are compared to graſſe, not only becauſe they wither, but becauſe they wither ſuddenly, or are cut downe by ſome hand of juſtice.

To graſſe, firſt, becauſe of their multitude, and ſecondly, becauſe of their beauty, they ſhall flouriſh and be green as the graſſe, which is very pleaſant to the beholders eye.</p>
                  <p>And in this alſo <hi>Eliphaz</hi> aimes at the death of <hi>Job's</hi> children; Thou haſt loſt thy children, they periſhed miſerably, but if thou <note place="margin">

                     <hi>under the influence of heavenly bleſſings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As grace doth not runne in a blood, ſo neither do bleſſings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly runne in a blood, yet the children of thoſe who are bleſſed, are neereſt a bleſſing: And their poſſibilities for mercy are faireſt. Many promiſes are made to them, <hi>they are heires apparent of the promiſes in their parents right;</hi> others to appearance, are ſtrangers from the promiſes. Though, we know free grace chuſeth often out of the naturall line; The mercies of God are his own, and it is his prerogative, <hi>to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When he ſummes up the bleſſings of a godly man, the bleſſings of his children are caſt into the account. Whence note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the bleſſings of the children, are the bleſſings of the parent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the parent is afflicted in the afflictions of his children, ſo he is bleſſed in their bleſſings. <hi>Relations ſhare mutually both in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and croſſes.</hi> Children are their parents multiplied, and every good of the child, is an addition to the parents good. <hi>A flouriſhing and a numerous poſterity is a great outward bleſſing.</hi> Some have the choiſeſt of ſpirituall bleſſings, who want this <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 56. 3.) God comforts thoſe that have no children, <hi>Doe not ſay that thou art made a dry tree; for I will give thee in mine houſe, a place and a name better than of ſons and daughters;</hi> As if he had ſaid, the name of ſons and of daughters, is a very great comfort, but it is not the greateſt comfort, the beſt bieſſing: thou ſhalt have a name and a place, better than of ſons and daughters.</p>
                  <q>Verſ. 26. <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a ſhock of corne commeth, in his ſeaſon.</hi>

                  <p>From perſonall preſent bleſſings of this life, and the bleſſings of poſterity, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> deſcends to ſhew the bleſſing of a godly man in death. A happy death is the cloſe of temporall happineſſe, and the beginning of eternall. A happy death ſtands between grace and glory, like the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> between the law and the Goſpel, and is the connexion or knitting of both. And as it was ſaid of <hi>John, That among them who are borne of women, there aroſe not a greater then he, nevertheleſſe, he that is leaſt in the kingdome of heaven, is greater then</hi> John: So we may ſay, that among all the bleſſings of this life, there is none greater then a bleſſed death, nevertheleſſe that which is leaſt in eternall life, is a greater bleſſing, then a bleſſed
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:40455:201"/> death. It was an obſervation among the Heathen, <hi>That no man is to be accounted bleſſed, untill he die.</hi> But when life is ſhut up with a bleſſing, then man is fully bleſſed; As in reaſoning, ſo in living, the concluſion lyes in the premiſes. <hi>A happy death is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of a holy life.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy grave.]</hi> That phraſe notes two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A willingneſſe and a chearfulneſſe to die. <hi>Thou ſhelt come,</hi> thou ſhalt not be dragged or hurried to thy grave, as it is ſaid of the fooliſh rich man, Luk. 12. <hi>This night ſhall thy ſoule be taken from thee.</hi> But <hi>thou ſhalt come to thy grave,</hi> thou ſhalt die quietly and ſmilingly, as it were, <hi>thou ſhalt goe to thy grave,</hi> as it were upon thine owne feet, and rather walke, then be carried to thy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it notes the honor and ſolemnity of burying. <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy grave with honour;</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Ahijah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> 1 King. 14. 12, 13. When Meſſengers were ſent to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to enquire whether he ſhould recover, the Prophet tels them, <hi>The child ſhall die, and all Iſrael ſhall mourne for him, and bury him: For, he only of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>ſhall Come to the grave, becauſe in him there is found ſome good thing toward the Lord God of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, in the houſe of</hi> Jeroboam. He only ſhall <hi>come to thy grave,</hi> the reſt ſhall be thruſt into the grave, or lye unburied, but he ſhall come, that is, he ſhall be buried with honour; others ſhall have reproach caſt upon them, when the earth is caſt upon them. <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy grave.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>But rather a <hi>full Age,</hi> notes here a ſulneſſe of daies, though the other (fullneſſe of eſtate) be not excluded. The Prophet puts the ſame difference, between aged men, and men full of dayes, as is between children, and young men (Jer. 6. 11.) <hi>I am full of the fury of the Lord, I will powre it out upon the children abroad, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

Therefore <hi>fulneſſe of age,</hi> is by others interpreted, to be ſtrength of age; thou ſhalt die in an old age, yet thou ſhalt have ſtrength and comfort in thy old-age; thine old-age ſhall not be a troubleſome age, thou ſhalt not be weake and crazy, diſtempered and ſick, a burthen to thy ſelfe, or friends; thou ſhalt die (as ſome tranſlate) <hi>in a good old-age,</hi> or as Mr. <hi>Broughton, thou ſhalt die in luſty old-age;</hi> Time ſhall not wither thee, nor drinke up thy blood and ſpirits, <hi>Thou ſhalt have a spring in the Autumne, and a Summer in the winter of thy life.</hi> As it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 34. 7. who died, when he was an hundred and twenty yeares old, yet ſaith the text, <hi>His eye was not dimme, nor his naturall force abated;</hi> This is to die in a full old-age, full of daies, yet full of ſtrength and health. It is a great bleſſing, when a man is (in this ſenſe) youthfull in old-age: when others ſee with foure eyes, and goe with three leggs, he uſes neither ſtaff nor ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but renews his ſtrength like the Eagle.</p>
                  <p>Or, we may take the ſenſe more generally, for any one that liveth long, and liveth comfortably; as it was ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 25. 8. <hi>That he died in a good old-age, an old man, and full of yeares.</hi> He died in a good old-age; The young-man is counſel'd, <hi>To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Creator in the dayes of his youth; before the evill daies come,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 1. What are thoſe? Thoſe evill daies are the daies of old-age: The words following being an Allegoricall, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant deſcription of old age. Old-age in it ſelfe is the evill day: The lives of many old-men are a continuall death. They live as it were upon the racke of extreame paines or ſtrong infirmities; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a ſpeciall bleſſing for man to be old, and yet to have a good old-age, that is, a florid comfortable old-age; <hi>To have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares and few infirmities</hi> is a rare thing. In ſome <hi>old-age flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,</hi> and in others <hi>old-age periſhes, Job</hi> gives us this difference in the uſe of this word, Chap. 30. 2. <hi>Yea whereto might the ſtrength of their hands profit me, in whom</hi> (Chelad) <hi>old-age was periſhed,</hi> As if he had ſaid, ſome old-men are active and ſtrong, but theſe, who were faded and flatted in all their abilities, in what
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:40455:202"/> ſtead could they ſtand me? They were a trouble to themſelves, and therefore could be no comfort unto others.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>full old-age</hi> is explained further, by way of ſimilitude, <hi>He ſhall die in a full age, lie as a ſhock of corne commeth in, in his ſeaſon.</hi> When a young man dye, he is as greene corne. The <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> imprecates that ſome may be like the <hi>graſſe</hi> or <hi>corne on the houſe-top, that withereth before it is cut downe, whereof the mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 129. 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth up the ſheaves, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</hi> The life of a man ſometimes is like corn growing upon the houſe top, that withereth: Or (as it is in the parable of the ſower, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.) like the corne that fell on the high-way ſide, or among ſtones and thornes, which came not in, in it's ſeaſon, it never ſtaid the ripening or reaping, but was eaten up or dried or choaked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the harveſt. Now here, man is compared unto corne, ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in good ground, well rooted and continuing out it's ſeaſon, and is brought in ripe at harveſt. <hi>Old-age is the harveſt of nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some divide mans life into ſeven parts, comparing it to the ſeven planets; Some into five, comparing it to the five acts of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude; but commonly the life of man is divided into foure parts, and ſo it is compared to the foure ſeaſons of the yeare. And in that diviſion, old-age is the winter-quarter, cold and cloudy, full of rheumes and catarrhs of diſeaſes and diſtellations. But here, old-age is the harveſt; though, thou art a very old-man, thou ſhalt not die as in winter, but thou ſhalt die, as it were in harveſt, when thou art full ripe and readie, as a <hi>ſhock of corne</hi> that is laid up in the barne; The generall judgement of the world is compared to a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and death (which is a particular day of judgement) is a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt too.</p>

                  <p>So then, the ſum of this verſe, is a promiſe of comfort and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in death: He ſhall die in a full age, when he is readie and ripe for death. Yet this is not to be taken ſtrictly, that, every godly man dies in ſuch a full old age, in an age full of daies or full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Many of Gods beſt ſervants have had evill daies in their old age; their old age hath had many daies of trouble and ſickneſs, of paine and perplexity. But thus it is with many in old age, and this is eſpecially to be look't upon as an <hi>Old Teſtament promiſe,</hi> when the Lord dealt more with his people, inviſible externall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Yet, in one ſenſe it is an univerſall truth, and ever fulfilled to his people, for whenſoever they die, they die in a good age, yea though they die in the ſpring and flower of youth, they die in a good old age; that is, they are ripe for death, when ever they die; when ever a godly man dies, it is harveſt time with him; though in a naturall capacity he be cut down, while he is green, and cropt in the bud or bloſſome, yet in his ſpirituall capacity, he never dies before he is ripe. God ripens his ſpeedily, when he intends to take them out of the world ſpeedily. He can let out ſuch warme rayes and beams of his Spirit upon them; as ſhall ſoone maturate the ſeeds of grace, into a preparedneſſe for glory: whereas a wicked man living an hundred yeaers, hath no full old-age, much leſſe a good old-age, <hi>he is ripe indeed for deſtruction, but he is never ripe for death;</hi> he is as unreadie and unripe for death, when he is an hundred years old, as when he was but a day old. He hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to live, when he dies; or he is at the end of his naturall race, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath ſet one ſtep in his ſpiritual. Gray haires are the ſhame, and ſhould be the ſorrow of old-age, when they are not found in the way of righteouſneſſe. From the former branch of this verſe, obſerve; Firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To have a comely buriall, to come to the grave with honour, is a great bleſſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was threatned upon <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> as a curſe, <hi>That he ſhould have the buriall of an Aſſe, and be drag'd and caſt out beyond the gates of the City,</hi> Jer. 22. 19. That man ſurely had lived like a beaſt, whom God threatn'd by name, that when he died, he ſhould be uſed as a beaſt: though we know the bodies of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:40455:203"/> many of the ſervants of God, have been ſcattered, and may be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the face of the earth, like dung; <hi>The dead bodies</hi> (as the complaint is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 2.) <hi>of thy ſervants have they given to be meat to the fowles of the heaven, the fleſh of thy Saints to the beaſts of the earth.</hi> Yet to them (even then) there is this bleſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, beyond the bleſſing of a buriall, they are ever laid up in the heart of God, he takes care of them, he embalmes them for immortality, when the remains of their mortality, are troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, or rot upon a dunghill.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>A godly man,</hi> is a <hi>volunteer in his death; He commeth to the grave:</hi> A wicked man, never dies willingly, <hi>Though he ſometime die by his own hand, yet he never dies with his own will.</hi> Miſerable man is ſometimes ſo over-preſt with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and horrours of conſcience, ſo worne out with the trouble of living, that he haſtens his own death. Yet he, <hi>Comes not to his grave willingly,</hi> but is drag'd by neceſſity. He thruſts his life out of doores with a violent hand, but it never goes out with a cheerfull mind. He is often unwilling to live, but he is never wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die. <hi>Death is welcome to him, becauſe life is a burden to him.</hi> Only they <hi>come</hi> to the grave, who, by faith have ſeene Chriſt lying in the grave, and perfuming that houſe of corruption, with his owne moſt precious body, which ſaw no corruption. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thirdly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To live long and to die in a full age is a great bleſſing.</hi> Old <hi>Eli</hi> had this curſe pronounced upon his family, 1 Sam. 2. 31. <hi>There ſhall not be an old man in thy houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gray haires are a crown of honour, when they are found in the way of righteouſneſſe. It is indeed infinitely better, to be full of grace, than to be full of daies; but to be full of daies, and full of grace too, what a venerable ſpectacle is that? To be full of years, and full of faith, full of good workes, full of the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which are by Chriſt, How comely and beautifull beyond all the beauty and comelineſſe of youth, is that? Such are truly ſaid to have filled their daies. Thoſe daies are fill'd indeed, which are full of goodneſſe. When a wicked man dies, he ever dies emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and hungrie; he dies empty of goodneſſe, and he dies hungry after daies. That place before mentioned of <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gen. 25. 8.) is moſt worthy our ſecond thoughts, <hi>He dies in a good old-age, an old man, and full,</hi> ſo the Hebrew, we reade, <hi>full of years;</hi> As a man, that hath eaten and drunke plentifully, is full; and deſires no
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:40455:204"/> more. So, <hi>he dyed an old-man and full,</hi> that is, he had lived as much as he deſired to live, <hi>he had his fill of living, when he died.</hi> And therefore alſo, it may be called a full age, becauſe a godly man hath his fill of living, but a wicked man (let him live never ſo long) is never full of daies, never full of living; he is as hungry and as thirſty (as a man may ſpeake) after more time and daies, when he is old, as he was when he was a child, faine he would live hill; <hi>He muſt needs thinke it is good being here, who knowes of no better being, or hath</hi>

It is a moſt ſad thing, to ſee an old man, who hath no ſtrength of body to live, yet have a ſtrong mind to live. <hi>Abraham</hi> was old and full, he deſired not a day, or an houre longer <hi>His ſoul had never an empty corner for time, when he died.</hi> He had enough of all, but (of which he could never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and yet had enough, and all, as ſoon as he had any of it) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. In that great reſtitution promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 20. this is one priviledge, <hi>There ſhall be no more there, an infant of daies, nor an old man that hath not fil'd his daies.</hi> There is much controverſie about the meaning of thoſe words; The digreſſion would be too long to inſiſt upon them. Only to the preſent point thus much, that there is ſuch a thing, as an Infant of daies, and <hi>an old man that hath not fill'd his daies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An infant of daies,</hi> may be taken for an <hi>old child, that is, an old man childiſh,</hi> or a man of many years, but few abilities. A man whoſe hoary head ann wrinkled face ſpeak <hi>fourſcoure,</hi> yet his fooliſh actions and ſimple carriage ſpeake under <hi>fourteene. An old man that hath not fill'd his daies,</hi> is conceived to be the ſame man, in a different character. An old man fils not his dayes. Firſt When he fulfils not the duty, nor reaches the end for which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to old-age; That man who hath lived long, and done little, hath left empty daies, upon the record of his life. And when you have writ downe the daies, the months, and yeares of his life, his ſtorie's done, the reſt of the book is but a <hi>continued Blanke,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be remembred that he hath done, or nothing worth the remembrance.</p>
                  <p>Now as an old man fils not his daies, when he ſatisfies not the expectation of others: ſo in the ſecond place his daies are not fill'd, when his own expectations are not ſatisfied, that is, when he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:40455:204"/> lived to be old, hath yet young freſh deſires to live, when he finds his mind empty, though his body be ſo full of daies, that it can hold no longer, nor no more. He that is in this ſenſe, an <hi>infant of dayes,</hi> and <hi>an old man not having filled his dayes,</hi> though he be an hundred yeares old when he dies, yet he dies (as the Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in that place) accurſed; he comes not to his grave under the bleſſing of this promiſe in the text, <hi>in a full age.</hi> Laſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>

Thoſe two wayes a man dyes before his time; Firſt, when he dyes without any ſtrength of grace; Secondly, when he dyes in the ſtrength of nature.

                  <p>A queſtion ariſes here, how <hi>Eliphaz</hi> can ſay, we have ſearcht it, when as <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. he ſaith, <hi>A thing was ſecretly brought to me?</hi> It ſeemes theſe were matters attained and beaten out by ſtudy, not ſent in by divine revelation; and ſo are rather the opinions of men, then the oracles of God. Men inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeak another language; As, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, or this we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not this we have ſearched.</hi> Scripture is given by inſpiration from God. not by the diſquiſitions of men</p>
                  <p>Some have hence concluded this ſpeech of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> Apocryphal, <note place="margin">

                  <p>But I anſwer. Firſt, The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſufficiently atteſted the Divine Authority of this diſcoruſe, by alledging a proof out of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That which was ſecretly brought to <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> was that one ſpeciall Oracle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Shall mortall man be more juſt then God? ſhall a man be more pure then his maker?</hi> The other part of his diſcourſe, to which theſe words <hi>(Loe this we have ſearched)</hi> refer, were grounded upon the experiences which himſelfe and his friends had obſerved in, and about the providence of God in all his dealings both with the godly and the wicked, all agreeable to that <hi>grand principle</hi> received by <hi>immediate revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And therefore as he told <hi>Job</hi> before, that the generall poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was brought him in a viſion, ſo all ages and the records kept of them (in all which he had made a diligent enquirie) came up fully to the proofe of it; As if he had ſaid, The Lord told me ſo, and all he hath done in the word proclaimes that it is ſo. His word is enough to aſſert his own juſtice, but his works witneſſe with it. <hi>Loe, this, we have ſearched, ſo it is.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>We have ſearched.</hi> He ſpeaks in the plurall number; he begun his ſpeech in the fourth Chapter, and he concluds it here in the plurall number. Yet we are not to think, that, this was a diſcourſe penn'd by them all together; or debated firſt in private conference, and agreed on, that thus <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſhould ſpeake, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>we have ſearched it.</hi> But the meaning is only this, I ſuppoſe I have ſpoken the ſenſe of my two friends, who ſtand by, and I beleeve they are ready to ſubſcribe to, or vote every word I have now ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, therefore <hi>behold we have ſearched and thus it is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:40455:206"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Heare thou it.</hi> To adviſe thee, was our part; to heare and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is thy part; therefore <hi>heare it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But had he not heard them all this while, why doth <hi>Eliphaz</hi> now bid him heare it?</p>
                  <p>It is true, he had heard; but there is more required, then the hearing of the eare, when ſuch a Sermon as this is preached. To heare, is more than the worke of the eare. It is</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To beleeve and give credit to what was heard. <hi>(Joh.</hi> 9. 27.) <hi>I told you before, and you would not heare</hi> (ſaith the blind man) <hi>wherefore would you heare it againe?</hi> that is, I have told you already, but you would not beleeve, nor give credit to what I ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To heare is to hearken, that is, to yeeld and conſent to what is ſpoken. <hi>(Gen.</hi> 3. 17.) <hi>Foraſmuch, as thou haſt hearkned to the counſell of thy wife:</hi> Barely to heare a temptation to ſin, is no act of ſin; as barely to heare an exhortation to good, is no act of grace. <hi>Therefore becauſe thou haſt hearkned,</hi> is, becauſe thou haſt yeelded and conſented to, that which ſhe hath ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To heare, is to obey. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. <hi>Heare and your ſoule ſhall live.</hi> It is not every hearing af the eare, that bringeth life to the ſoule, obedient hearing is enlivening hearing.</p>
                  <p>So here, <hi>we have ſearched it, ſo it is, heare it,</hi> that is, beleeve what we have ſpoken, ſubmit unto, and conſent to what we have ſpoken, obey and practiſe what we haveſpoken.</p>
                  <p>To heare, is both an act of ſence, and an act of reaſon, an act of nature, and an act of grace. To heare one requeſting and praying is to grant: and to heare one counſelling and commanding, is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. When God heares man, he grants; and when man heares God, or heares men ſpeaking in the name of God, he yeelds and obeys.</p>
                  <p>It followes, <hi>And know thou it for thy good.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>know it for thy ſelfe.</hi> Now, becauſe that which a man knowes for <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> himſelfe, is for his profit, therefore we tranſlate, <hi>know it for thy good;</hi> that is, know it as that, whereby thy ſelfe mayeſt receive good. The meaning of, <hi>know it for thy ſelfe,</hi> is not this, know and keep it to thy ſelfe, let none partake with thee of it; It is againſt the uſe of knowledge, that a man ſhould ſo know for himſelfe, though a mans ſelfe hath or may have good by all he knowes. So we muſt underſtand that of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prov. 9. 12. <hi>If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelfe;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt be advantag'd by thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; Wiſdome brings in a faire revenew; though many know
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:40455:206"/> much and ſeem very wiſe, who know nothing for themſelves, and are not wiſe at all, for their own good.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of <hi>knowing men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some know onely to know. They know, but the propoſe no end to themſelves, beyond knowledge: They know not for the good of others, no nor for their own good. As it is with riches and honour, ſo with knowledge: covetous men gather riches that they may be rich, they propoſe not any other end of having riches, but only to be rich. An ambitious man, deſires honor, that he may be honourable, he propoſeth to himſelfe no other end of his deſiring honor, but to be honourable. So many are covetous and ambitious of knowledge, they read from book to book, and from point to point, from ſcience to ſcience, and what do they with all this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? only this, that they may know; to know thus, is not to know for good, <hi>To know only to know, is no better then not to know.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others know, that they may be knowne, to know this is their end, that other men may know that they are knowing men, that they are great Schollars, great read-men, men of great abilities and boundleſſe ſtudies. Even as ſome deſire riches, that they may be accounted rich, and honour, that they may be fam'd for honourable. <hi>To know only that we may be known, is worſe then not to know.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thirdly. That which is the right way of knowing, is to know that others may know, or, to know that our ſelves may practiſe. Theſe are the true ends of knowing, to communicate knowledg and to obey knowledge. The great end of knowing ſhould be our own profiting in holineſſe and obedience. And ſo here, <hi>Know it for thy good,</hi> is, to know it ſo, as to make an advantage of thy knowledg. <hi>To know for our good, is the only good knowledge.</hi> Hence obſerve, firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth deſerves our moſt diligent ſearch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We have ſearched it</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz)</hi> The promiſe of finding truth, is only to ſuch as ſearch for truth <hi>(Prov.</hi> 2. 4.) <hi>Thou ſhalt find wiſdome, &amp;c. If thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid treaſures.</hi> There are two places, two veines eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, where truth is to be found; <hi>There is the book of Gods word, and the book of Gods works: The book of Scripture, and the book of providence;</hi> In theſe two books, we are to ſearch, in them to ſtudy out truth, for our own practiſe, and for adviſe to others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which we offer to others for truth, we ought diligently to</hi>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:40455:207"/> 
                     <hi>make tryall of our ſelves; or we ſhould make truth our own, before we diſtribute it to others</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſearched the thing out (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz)</hi> we know the truth to be thus, we are maſters of what we teach. They who hear aright, ſearch (as the <hi>Bereans)</hi> thoſe things, which are taught them; and they who inſtruct aright, ought to ſearch the things which they teach; If there muſt be after-ſearching of thoſe things we hear, certainly there muſt be fore-ſearchings of the things we teach. <hi>Truth (ordinarily) is not worth the having unleſſe it be come in by our own ſearching.</hi> They who receive that for truth which they never ſearcht, will not hold any truth when themſelves are ſearcht. Truths merely borrowed and taken upon truſt, are no ſtock, no abiding treaſure of knowledge; And yet moſt can only ſay of all the truth they have, as he of his <hi>axe head,</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 5.) <hi>Alas maſter, for it was borrowed;</hi> they ſnatch up one truth from this hand, and another from that, they take it upon the credit of this and that learned man; very few are able to ſay (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> here) <hi>Loe this, we have ſearched it:</hi> The more paines we take to find truth, the more pleaſure we take in it; That is ſweeteſt to us, which we ſweat moſt for, in praying and ſtudying: Morſells of Truth dipt in that ſawce, fatten and ſtrengthen the ſoul moſt.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve thirdly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What a man knoweth by ſearch and diſquiſition, he is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>We have ſearched it;</hi> and what follows? <hi>ſo it is;</hi> He ſpeaks with authority, not timerouſly, as if he doubted whether it were ſo or no; but, <hi>ſo it is,</hi> we will bide by it, we have it upon enquiry and diligent ſearch. Obſerve fourthly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The truths we know our ſelves, we ſhould communicate unto others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here it is,</hi> we have ſearched it, but we will not put the light we have found, under a buſhell; we will not hide the talent we have in a napkin: Here it is, make what uſe of it thou canſt, <hi>know it for thy good.</hi> Obſerve fifthly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth may challenge credit, and command the eare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hear thou it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Truth needs not ſtand begging audience, or creep upon the ground with flattering inſinuations, or humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to gaine acceptance. Truth is a great Prince, and may ſpeak in the language of Princes; <hi>We will, We require;</hi> It commands rather then entreats, or all its entreaties commands, every word a
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:40455:207"/> law or a charge: <hi>Hear thou it.</hi> Obſerve in the ſixth place, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is needfull to make speciall application of generall doctrinall truths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had delivered a doctrinall truth, and here he makes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; And though he failed much, in the application of it to <hi>Job,</hi> yet there were generall truths very appliable, in the things he delivered. Therefore he ſtays not in generals, nor leaves his doctrine hovering in the ayre, but brings it home to the heart, and layes it cloſe to the conſcience; <hi>Hear thou it, and know it thou, for thy good.</hi> And not onely are nationall and ſpeculative truths to be brought home and applied, but even common experimentall truths, ſuch were theſe diſcuſſed, and handled by <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> Obſerve ſeventhly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A man may know much, and yet get no good by it.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Know this for thy good.</hi> The Devil is a great Scholler, he knows much, but he knows nothing for his benefit, but all for his hurt. Many a man knowes almoſt all that is knowable; but he knowes nothing which is (to him) profitable: <hi>Nothing gaines by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but onely his pride,</hi> he is puffed up with knowledge, not built up, and <hi>that knowledge which puffes up, will at laſt puffe down, or caſt us down.</hi> Eightly Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A godly man, may make a profitable uſe of any Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee what truths <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake; many of them ordinary, common Doctrines, and many of them ſore threatnings and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon wicked men, yet <hi>know thou this for thy good.</hi> There is no veine of Doctrine in the book of God, but a man may make uſe, yea treaſure of it. All truth is ſo ſymbolical to the regenerate part, that it cannot but more ſublimate and ſpiritualize a ſpirituall heart, though it ſelfe be a truth about things earthly and temporall.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve laſtly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All truths, eſpecially truths contained in the promiſes, are the portion of a godly man.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Know thou it for thy good,</hi> ſaith he; As if he ſhould ſay, if thou art a godly man, then all the good things I have here ſpoken of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to godly men, belong to thee, they are thy portion alſo. While a believer reads the book of God, he ſees great riches, many precious things in the promiſes, and whatſoever good he findes there, there is nothing of it too good for him; he may know it all for his own good; thoſe ſweet delicious promiſes of the pardon of ſin, of the love of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the freeneſſe of grace, of the glory to come, the promiſes of Chriſt, and of all that is Chriſts, all theſe
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:40455:208"/> things are his, when he reads them, he may ſet his mark upon them, and know them for his goods, know them as his own proper goods. Unbelievers are ſtrangers to the promiſes, and the promiſes are as ſtrange to them, they know not the promiſes, and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will not know them: They know not a letter of Scripture for their good. The very promiſes are threatnings to them, and the very bleſſings of the book of God, are their curſe. As the clouds paſſe over this and that piece of ground, and then diſſolve upon a third, by the directing and all diſpoſing providence of God: So the promiſes (which are full of bleſſings, full of comforts, as the clouds are of ſhowers) paſſe over a wicked mans head, and let not down one drop of mercy or comfort upon him, but leave him like the <hi>dry hearth, or barren wilderneſſe, which ſeeth not when good cometh,</hi> Jer. 17. 6. But when the cloud moves a little farther, and meets with the family or perſon of a godly man, there it diſſolves and powreth out a <hi>plentifull raine</hi> (both of temporall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bleſſings) <hi>to refreſh and confirme that inheritance of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 68. 9.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much for this fifth Chapter, wherein, with the fourth, we have handled the firſt part of the diſpute undertaken againſt <hi>Job,</hi> by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> the firſt of his three friends. The whole diſcourſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of divers arguments, to convince and humble him under the hand of God: of divers counſels and motives to perſwade and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him to ſeek unto God, and ſubmit to his correcting hand: All he was to ſpeak, being let in, by a loving preface, and all he ſpake, being ratified, with an aſſuring concluſion, that all he had ſpoken was for his good, if he would hear, believe and obey. In the next Chapters we ſhall hear <hi>Job</hi> making his defence, ſcattering the charge thus brought againſt him, ſtiffely maintaining, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately renewing his firſt complaint.</p>

In this reply, <hi>Job</hi> ſhapes and formes up anſwers unto both. I ſhall endeavour to give you a briefe of the whole, and then to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Job</hi> enters with a refutation of thoſe reproofes of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had heap't upon him; and with that ſubjoyns a refuſall of the counſels (in his ſence) which he had given him. In this work, ſeven verſes of the Chapter are ſpent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have a renovation or a re-inforcement of his grief and deſire to die, from the 8 to the end of the 13 verſe, <hi>O that I might have my requeſt, that God would cut me off,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, I am ſo far, from being ſatisfied, with what thou haſt ſpoken againſt me, or from recanting and recalling, what I have ſpoken, in thoſe my breathings after death, that I will be bold to make the ſame ſuit to God againe, <hi>O that I might have my requeſt, and that God would cut me off!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He proceeds to a charge of raſh cenſure, of uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea of deceitfull dealing upon his friends, from the 13 unto the 24 verſe. <hi>To him that is afflicted</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pity ſhould be ſhewed from his friend, my brethren have dealt deceitfully, as a brooke,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He yet ſubmits himſelf to their judgement and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:40455:209"/> if they would ſpeak reaſon to him at laſt, and come home to his caſe indeed; or, if they could fully and candidly diſcover to him any errour, he was willing to be rectified; This he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (and it is a moſt ingenious profeſſion) in the 24. and 25. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Teach me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I will hold my tongue, and cauſe me to underſtand wherein I have erred,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, All that you have ſpoken hitherto, doth not reach my condition, ye have quite miſtook my caſe; yet, you ſhall ſee, I doe not ſtand out againſt you, becauſe I will ſtand out, it is not my will that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes what you have ſpoken, but my underſtanding; therefore, if you can ſhew me better reaſon, I lay down the bucklers, and yield my ſelfe a priſoner to your ſelves, and unto truth. I delight not to lengthen out contentions, nor am I reſolved to have the laſt word, <hi>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He adds an expoſtulation, mixed with an aggravation. An expoſtulation about, and an aggravation of their high jealouſie, and low opinion of him, in the 26. and 27. verſes, <hi>Doe ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> wind?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Doe you think, that you have had to deale with a man, that onely makes a noyſe, or ſpeaks a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, which have more ſound then ſence: doe ye think I am out of my wits, and in ſtead of arguing with you, doe onely rave like a mad man at you? Ye have not had vaine, windy words from me, but words full of weight and matter, words of truth and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherefore then doe you ſpeak thus? <hi>Doe ye imagine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove words, and the speeches of one that is deſperate?</hi> Doe ye think I ſpeak like one, who knows not what he ſpeaks? Or that, I have at once loſt my hope, and my underſtanding?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, He gives them advice and admonition to take better heed, to what they ſhould after ſay, if they intended to to ſay any more, or to continue their counſell and diſcourſe with him; in the three laſt verſes of this ſixth Chapter. <hi>Now therefore be content, looke upon me, for it is evident to you, if I lie, returne I pray you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, (which concludes his ſpeech) he offers three things, eſpecially to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A renewing of many arguments and conſiderations, by which he confirmes the equity of his requeſt, to have his life cut off; upon which ſad ſubject he inſiſts, from the beginning of the Chapter, to the end of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. <hi>Is there not an appointed</hi>
                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:40455:209"/> 
                     <hi>time to man upon the earth? Are not his dayes like the dayes of an Hireling?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, After all his high ſtraines of conteſt with man, we have an abaſement of himſelfe, as unworthy that God ſhould take notice of him, either by mercies or judgements, in the 18. and 19. verſes. <hi>What is man, that thou ſhouldſt magnifie him, and that thou ſhouldeſt viſit him every morning?</hi> &amp;c. A godly man will ſtand (when he ſees cauſe) upon his termes with men, but he ever falls low before, and hath not a word to reply againſt God. He is ſometime angry, when men vilifie him, but he ever admires, why God ſhould magnifie him. <hi>What is man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He concludes his ſpeech with an humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own ſinfulneſſe, and with an earneſt requeſt for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his ſin. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, O, thou preſerver of men,</hi> verſ. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After all this heat and paſſion, after all theſe complainings, <hi>Jobs</hi> heart lay levell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, yea he abaſes himſelfe to exalt and give glory to God, with humble confeſſion, and an earneſt ſupplication for the pardon of his ſin. Thus we have the generall parts and ſubſtance of his anſwer to that charge of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> in the two former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>But</hi> Job <hi>anſwered and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>In theſe words, and the three following verſes, <hi>Job</hi> gives us the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation or rejection of that reproof, given him by <hi>Eliphaz;</hi> And he refutes it by ſhewing the reaſon why <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (as he ſuppoſed) was ſo ſharpe and bitter in reproving him. And further, he ſhews cauſe why he rejects his counſell or conſolation. The reaſon upon <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amicos taxat, quod antequam ipſum reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ent, non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiſſent ſuam miſeriam.</hi> Coc.</note> which he puts off thoſe reproofs is this, becauſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had not duly conſidered his ſorrowes, or was not ſo ſenſible of them, as a man ſhould be, that undertakes a friend in his condition. The ſum of his argument, againſt what <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had ſpoken, may be thus formed;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He cannot duly reprove or convince another of impatience in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, who hath not fully weighed thoſe calamities, which are the cauſe and ground of thoſe complaints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Eliph. z, <hi>thou haſt not fully weighed and conſidered my caſe and condition, my troubles and calamities, which are the ground and cauſe of my complaints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore thou canſt not duly reprove or convince me of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi>
                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:40455:210"/> The Aſſumption or ſecond Propoſition of this argument, is couched in the ſecond verſe, <hi>O that my griefe were throughly weighed, and that my calamity were laid in the ballances together!</hi> As if he had ſaid, I had never received ſuch harſh cenſures, ſuch a judgement or reproofe, if thou hadſt duly weighed my ſorrows; if thou hadſt faithfully ſtudied my caſe, thou hadſt never rebuked me thus.</p>
                  <p>The weight of his calamity, himſelfe expreſſeth two ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Comparatively, at the third verſe, by putting it into the ballance with the ſand of the ſea; <hi>For now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it would be heavier than the ſand of the ſea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſets forth the greatneſs of his calamity, demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, by declaring in what manner he had been afflicted, My af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is not an ordinary affliction; <hi>I am wounded with the arrows of the Almighty, and thoſe poiſoned arrows, and thoſe arrows drinking up my spirits.</hi> I have not onely ſome ſingle great affliction, or many ſmall ones upon me; but, <hi>I have terrour, and terrours, yea I have an army of terrours, yea an army of terrours always incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about me, and charging me continually, why</hi> Eliphaz <hi>thou didſt never clearly conſider theſe things, much leſſe haſt thou had a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or fellow-feeling of them. Thou haſt not bin afflicted in my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: Thou haſt not ſorrowed my ſorrowes, nor wept my tears;</hi> Therefore it is, that thou haſt ſo ſharply reproved me, and put ſo much gall and wormwood into thy diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>So then, the ſumme of this firſt part may be thus given, taking it out of thoſe high and hyperbolicall ſtraines, in which his paſſion was carried; as if <hi>Job</hi> had thus anſwered <hi>Eliphaz, It is an eaſie matter to ſlight that which a man doth not know, and to thinke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers complaine too much, when we our ſelves feel nothing; but is it any wonder to heare a man groane, that hath a burthen upon his backe, as heavy as the ſand of the Sea? Is it any wonder to heare a man cry out, whoſe fleſh is filled with poyſoned arrows, ſhot from a bow, bent and drawn by the arme of omnipotency? Is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if that man feare, who is incompaſt about with terrours? Is it any wonder, if that man be troubled, who hath the terrours of the Almighty incamping about him? Why</hi> Eliphaz, <hi>thou wouldſt not think, that an Oxe or an Aſſe were reprovable, if the one ſhould low when he hath no graſſe, and the other bray when he hath no fodder; if it be ſo, that the very irrationall creatures doe according to reaſon, when they complaine upon their wants, doeſt thou think me desperate</hi>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:40455:210"/> 
                     <hi>or irrationall in complaning of mine? Alas all my fodder and my graſſe, all my comforts and refreſhings are taken from me: Doſt thou not ſee, how, upon a due conſideration of my eſtate, all thy reproofes may be wiped off from me, or retorted upon thy ſelf? what great matter is it, if thou doſt not complain, who ſitteſt at eaſe and knoweſt no ſorrow? Thou art in green paſtures or full barns, thou haſt graſſe and fodder in abundance, and therefore haſt no cauſe of complaint.</hi> Thus in the generall.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>But</hi> Job <hi>anſwered and ſaid.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To anſwer,</hi> is here taken properly: he anſwers to a charge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, or argument. At the third Chapter; verſe the firſt, when <hi>Job</hi> beganne to ſpeake, it is ſaid, Job <hi>anſwered and ſaid.</hi> In Scripture language anſwering is often put for ſpeaking, though none have ſpoken a word or made any propoſall before. But here anſwering is taken in a ſtrict ſenſe, as it notes a reply to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before ſpoken; Job <hi>anſwered and ſaid.</hi> Note this from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is the duty of a man to anſwer, when he is queſtioned or charged.</hi> It is the Ahoſtles rule (1 Pet. 3. 15.) <hi>Be ready alwaies to give an anſwer to every man, that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you.</hi> As a man in duty ought to give a reaſon of the hope that is in him; ſo in duty he ought to give a reaſon of the ſorrows that are in him, and of the complaints that proceed from him; <hi>We muſt anſwer for our paſſions, as well as for our speeches; we muſt anſwer for our ſorrows, and for our joyes, and for our feares; as well as for our hope, or for our faith.</hi> Theſe muſt all be anſwered for, and when any ſhall charge us about any of theſe, we muſt be ready to give a reaſon of them (as the Apoſtle adviſes there, in the caſe of our hope) <hi>with meekneſſe and feare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is our duty to anſwer thus, both in reference to our ſelves and others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is our duty in reference to our ſelves, that wee may vindicate that, which ſhould be more precious to us, then the <hi>gold of Ophir,</hi> our own credit or ſincerity, <hi>No man ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiſe his owne integrity or reputation, ſo, as not to ſtand up for it.</hi> Therefore <hi>Job</hi> growes reſolute in that point, profeſſing <hi>that he would hold his integrity, till he died,</hi> he would never let that goe, but anſwer ſtiffely for it: It is juſtice to diſ-aſperſe our ſelves, and give witneſſe to our own wronged innocency. A man is more
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:40455:211"/> bound in duty to ſtand up for himſelf, then for any other, by how much he is nearer to himſelf, then to others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is our duty to anſwer in reſpect of others; (and that <hi>Job</hi> might have an eye unto) namely to ſatisfie thoſe, who are ſcandalized, by what we have either done or ſpoken: Suppoſe, it be not a ſcandall given, ſuppoſe, it be onely a ſcandall taken, as this of <hi>Job</hi> was: <hi>Job</hi> did nothing purpoſely to ſcandalize them, nor any thing, which upon a due conſideration, was a ſcandall, but his friends had taken ſcandall at what he ſpake, his impatient complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: therefore he was bound in duty to ſatisfie them, and to ſhew further grounds, wherefore he ſo complained. <hi>Silence when we</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si accuſatus non reſpondeat aut criminis convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus aut certé ſuſpectus videa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Pined.</note> 
                     <hi>are charged, either makes a full conviction, or ſtrengthens ſuſpition;</hi> And in this caſe, if <hi>Job</hi> had held his peace, he had either yeelded the cauſe, and confeſ'd himſelf guilty, or at leaſt his friends ſhould have had cauſe to grow higher in their jealouſies of his ſincerity. <hi>To right our ſelves is not a point of indifferency, but of dutie. Selfe-love is the rule of our love to others. He who neglects his own wronged ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, will not be very carefull (which yet he ought) of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>O that my griefe were throughly weighed!</q>
                  <p>Griefe may be conſidered two wayes, either <hi>Paſſively</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</hi> Griefe taken <hi>Paſſively</hi> is the thing which we ſuffer, or, which is grievous to us; affliction it ſelfe is called griefe. Take griefe <hi>Actively,</hi> and then it is the ſorrow we expreſſe, under the preſſures of grievous afflictions.

So all the ſuffering of this life are light, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the exceeding weight of one ſin, commited by us.

                     <hi>is the Receiver;</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>Where is the weigher;</hi> that is, either the <hi>spirituall weigher;</hi> He that uſes to be ſo exact in weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every tittle of the law. Or, the <hi>Civill weigher,</hi> becauſe they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to weigh all the mony, they received. So then, <hi>O that my griefe were throughly weighed,</hi> is as if he had ſaid, O that my grief were weighed, as gold and ſilver is weighed, weighed exactly, to the leaſt, to the utmoſt, that you might fully know what it is.</p>
                  <p>The word ſingle by it ſelfe, notes an exact examination by weighing, but when (as here) the word is doubled, or (by an Hebraiſme) repeated, <hi>O that my griefe in weighing were weighed,</hi> it heightens and increaſes the ſenſe exceedingly: Hence we tranſlate <hi>O that my griefe were throughly weighed,</hi> weighed ſo, as that there might be a cleare diſcovery, how much my ſorrows weigh. The doubling of a word, to this ſence, is very frequent in Scripture, I ſhall not need to inſtance. Take only that (Gen. 2. 17.) <hi>Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evill, thou ſhalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, in dying, thou ſhalt die,</hi> (that is) <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> So here, O that in weighing it were weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, <hi>O that it were throughly and exactly weighed</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lay all together, and it imports thus much; as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, I would not have my ſorrows weighed at a vulgar beame, or in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ballances, I would not have the ſound or letter only of what I have ſpoken conſidered, but I deſire that you would take my complaints together, the words and the matter, and that you would weigh all impartially, that you may come to a full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, what my condition is; and then ſurely you would give up a better judgement, and make a fairer interpretation of my
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:40455:212"/> words, then as yet you have put forth: Thus he ſpeaks alſo Chapter. 31 6. <hi>Let me be weighed in an even ballance, that God may know my integrity.</hi> Uneven ballances will not make a perfect diſcovery: That which is falſe, cannot give a true report: Things and perſons act as they are; therefore <hi>Job</hi> deſireth to be weighed in an <hi>even ballance,</hi> ſuch a beame will ſpeake the truth of my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, both to God and man; God needs no meanes to make him know, he knowes all immediately, and he weighes by his eye, not one thing by another, but all things in themſelves; <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of God after the manner of men</p>

                     <note place="margin">Bolduc.</note> 
                     <hi>my griefe and calamity were laid in the ballances together,</hi> that is, O that my griefe were put, one into one ballance, and my calamity into another; or, O that my griefe might be weighed with my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and it would appeare (notwithſtanding your judgement of me) that yet, there is nothing ſo much weight in my greife, as there is in my calamity, that is, I have not yet grieved or complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up to the height or weight of thoſe calamities, which are upon me: So that if my ſorrow were laid in one ballance, and my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in another, my affliction would outweigh my ſorrow, and it would appeare, that I have complained, not only, not without a cauſe, but not ſo much, as I had cauſe.</p>
                  <p>And to prove that his calamity was heavier then his griefe, he adds in the next words; <hi>It,</hi> (namely his calamity thus weighed) <hi>would be heavier then the ſand of the ſea:</hi> As if he had ſaid, it is poſſible that in trying all heavy things, ſomewhat might be found heavier then my griefe or my complaint hath been; but I am ſure nothing can be found of equal weight with my calamity, for my <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity</hi> (which is the immediate antecedent) <hi>would be heavier than</hi>

                     <hi>the ſand of the ſea,</hi> then which, nothing can be found more heavy.</p>
                  <p>That of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 62. 9. is paralell to this expreſſion in <hi>Job, Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lye; To be laid in the ballances, they are altogether lighter then vanity.</hi> The meaning is, That if men of all degrees, high and low were put in one ſcale, and <hi>vanity</hi> in the other, vanity it ſelfe would be weightier then the graveſt and moſt weighty men: Hence ſome reade, <hi>They together are lighter then vanity;</hi> Others to this ſence, <hi>Men and vanity being weighed together,</hi> vanity will not be ſo light, as vaine man. As <hi>David,</hi> to ſhew mans lightneſſe, makes him lighter then the lighteſt thing, <hi>vanity.</hi> So <hi>Iob,</hi> to ſhew the heavineſſe of his calamity, makes it heavier then the heavieſt thing, <hi>the fand of the ſea.</hi> Obſerve hence; firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is a duty, to weigh the ſad eſtate, and afflicted condition of our brethren thoroughly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (you will ſay) what is it to weigh them throughly?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It is not only to weigh the matter of an affliction, to ſee what it is, which aman ſuffers; but to weigh an affliction in every circumſtance and aggravation of it; <hi>The circumstance of an affliction, is often more conſiderable then the matter of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> If a man would confeſſe his ſins, and confeſſe them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is to confeſſe, not only the matter of them; as ſins are the tranſgreſſions of the <hi>Law,</hi> and errors againſt the <hi>rule,</hi> but he muſt eye the manner, in which ſin hath been committed, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with which it is cloathed, theſe render his <hi>ſin out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and out of weight ſinful.</hi> Likewiſe would a man conſider the mercies and favours received from God, would he know them throughly, and ſee how much they weigh? let him look not only what, but how, and when, and where, and by whom he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them. <hi>There may be (and often is) a great wickedneſs in a little evil committed, and a great mercy in a little good received.</hi> As relations, ſo circumſtances have the leaſt entitie, but they have the greateſt efficacie. Now, as there is often more in the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than in the matter of a ſin, or of a mercy ſo, there is often more in the circumſtance, than there is in the matter of an affliction, therefore, he that would thoroughly weigh the afflictions of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt conſider all theſe accidents, as wel as the ſubſtance of it. As namely, the time when ſent, the time how long endured, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſingle affliction, or in conjucture with other afflictions, the ſtrength of the patient, and the dependencies that are upon him.</p>
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:40455:214"/>
                  <p> Secondly, He that would weigh an affliction throughly, muſt put himſelfe in the caſe of the afflicted, and (as it were) make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers griefe, his owne. He muſt act the paſſions of his brother, and a while perſonate the poore, the ſick, the afflicted man. He muſt get ataſt of the wormwood, and of the gall, upon which his brother fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. In a word, He muſt lay ſuch a condition to heart: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Malachy</hi> threatens a curſe upon thoſe, who laid not the word and works of God to heart <hi>(Chap.</hi> 2. 2,) <hi>I will curſe your bleſſings</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>becauſe ye doe not lay it to heart;</hi> that is, ye doe not conſider, what I ſay or doe, throughly: God curſed them throughly, becauſe they would not throughly conſider His Laws and judgements: So then, to weigh the affliction of another throughly, is to put our ſoules, as it were, in their ſoules ſtead: Hence, that we may be aſſured, Chriſt hath throughly weighed all our afflictions, He is ſaid <hi>to be afflicted in all our afflictions;</hi> He doth not only intuitively conſider or contemplate them, but he is (though above enduring) as, actually enduring them. He is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in all our afflictions, that is, he conſiders our afflictions as his owne, and is affected with them, as if himſelfe were pained with all our paines: and therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>himſelfe tooke our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes,</hi> Mat. 8. 17. the meaning is, he weighed the griefe of his people fully. In theſe two points, this holy art of weighing griefe conſiſts, conſideration of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ſimpathy of the ſmart. Meere ſpeculation moves little. We have no feeling of anothers ſuffering, till we have a fellow-feeling. The bare Theory of affliction, affects no more, then the bare Theory of fire, heates.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>O that my griefe were throughly weiged;</hi> we may obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is an addition to a mans affliction, when others are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his affliction.</hi> For it is, as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid; This makes me cry out ſo much of the weight of my ſorrows, becauſe my friends weigh them ſo little. The Church <hi>(Lam.</hi> 1. 12.) complaines thus, <hi>Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſſe by? behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow.</hi> Is it nothing to you? as if the Church had ſaid; My affliction is ſomething to me, and this aflicts me, above all my affliction, that paſſengers and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſlight my calamities, and think my affliction no affliction; that is, not ſo great, as indeed it is: Or, it is nothing to them, (they are not toucht with it) how great ſoever, they ſee it is to me: That
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:40455:214"/> which wounds and breakes my heart, doth not prick their little fingers. And becauſe, man is ſo ready to afflict his brother with this negative affliction, a not being ſenſible of his afflictions, therefore the Apoſtle aſſures us <hi>(Heb.</hi> 4. 15.) That <hi>we have not an High Prieſt that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are.</hi> This is ſpoken to comfort the Saints in their extreameſt ſufferings; what though men will not take notice and be ſenſible of your condition? what though men will not weigh your griefe? <hi>yet Chriſt will;</hi> our High Prieſt, is none of your ſenſeleſſe Prieſts, who care not what weather the People endure, ſo they be warme and at eaſe. Thirdly obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We can never rightly judge, till we throughly weigh the condition of an afflicted brother.</hi> For <hi>Job</hi> conceiv'd that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> proceeded to judgement, before he had been in conſideration. This is the reaſon why thou haſt judged me uncharitably, becauſe thou haſt not weighed me ſeriouſly. To ſhew, that conſideration muſt goe before judgement, God himſelfe is expreſt to us, in Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſtate of things, before himſelfe judges. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in the caſe of the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> and <hi>Gen.</hi> 18<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> in the caſe of the men of <hi>Sodome,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>that the Lord came downe to ſee, whether they had done altogether, according to that cry, which was come up unto him;</hi> Not, as if the Lord moves from one place to another, from Heaven to earth, for he filleth all places; not that the Lord needs come down to receive information, or to examine his own intelligence, to ſee whether things are, as they are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but, it is only an alluſion to the manner of men, or, to ſhew, that he doth not cenſure or judge any man, or men, or Nations, till he hath taken a full cogniſance of their condition. Now if God, who is infinite in knowledge and wiſdome, repreſents himſelfe coming downe, and by degrees deliberating about and weighing the eſtates of men, before he cenſures them, what need then have blindfold men, ignorant men, men, who at beſt have much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe mixed with their light, what need (I ſay) have they to examine, weigh and try every mans eſtate, before they ſentence or determine it? Fourthly obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A man, who hath not been, or is not afflicted himſelfe, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend, what another endures, who is under affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As there are comforts, eſpecially ſpirituall comforts, which no man knows or can know, but by the enjoying of them: The <hi>white</hi>
                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:40455:215"/> 
                     <hi>ſtone</hi> (promiſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17.) <hi>hath a new name written in it, which no man knowes, ſaving he that receiveth it;</hi> A man that is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to Chriſt and his wayes, is not able to make any judgement what the comforts and refreſhings of a Chriſtian are. He admires to heare men ſpeak of ſpirituall comforts and conſolations, he knowes not the meaning of thoſe things. <hi>The naturall man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, becauſe they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. It is ſo (proportionably) in all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and afflictions, eſpecially in ſpirituall ſorrowes and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which lye off from ſence, yea, which lye quite beyond the reach and borders of reaſon: ſpirituall ſorrowes, the hidings of Gods face, the withdrawing of aſſiſtance, few pity in others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe few have had experience of theſe things, in themſelves. They think men are mad, when they complaine of ſuch afflictions; when they cry out of their ſins, of the want of the favour of God, and the ſhining of his love, of deadneſſe and coldneſſe in duty, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe and hardneſſe of heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to aſſure our hearts that he hath a full ſence of all our ſorrows, taſted himſelfe of our ſorrowes. There is not any ſorrow that can be upon any ſoul, or any affliction that can be upon the body, but our Lord Jeſus hath had (ſome way or other) an experience of it: This makes him (to our apprehenſions) moſt fit to judg and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate the diſtreſſes of his people. As all the ſins of his people were laid upon him, ſo all their ſorrowes were laid upon him too; therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribes him thus, <hi>Ch.</hi> 53. 3. <hi>A man of ſorrowes and acquainted with griefe;</hi> Griefe and he were no ſtrangers, while he was here upon the earth, griefe was his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Familiar (as it were) that went up and down with him, all the while he travelled here below. Therefore ſeeing it is ſo, the whole church and every particular believer, have ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in their ſorrows, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh their condition, and knoweth fully what it is, <hi>We have not</hi> (as was toucht before) <hi>an High-Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;</hi> why, what aſſurance have we of this? it followes, <hi>He was tempted in all things like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, yet without ſin.</hi> Chriſt had temptations unto ſin, yet without ſin, therefore he knowes how to ſuccour us, when we are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto ſin; Chriſt was tempted by manifold ſorrowes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knowes how to ſuccour us, when we are under manifold ſorrowfull temptations: If we had a Mediatour in Heaven
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:40455:215"/> that had not been tempted on earth, we might doubt whether he would be toucht with the feeling of our infirmities, whether ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning infirmities, or ſorrowing infirmities. And were it not, that ſome of the Saints have been tempted and tryed, they, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tryals and temptations, would find none on earth, to ſuccour them. <hi>As God doth comfort ſome in all their tribulations, that they may be able to comfort them, which are in any trouble, with the ſame comforts wherewith they themſelves are comforted of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 4. So he afflicts them, that they might pity and helpe others, as being under the ſame troubles, with which themſelves have been affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. A man that hath only traveld in Geographicall books and Maps, is not able to give you ſuch lively deſcriptions of, or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about forreigne Countries, as he that hath traveld to, and been upon the places; ſo, they who have read and ſtudied much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout afflictions, can never give ſuch enlivening, ſtrengthening, heartning counſell, as they, who have been afflicted, and have dwelt ſometime upon the Land of ſorrowes, To paſſe on.</p>
                  <q>For now it would be heavier than the ſand of the Sea.</q>
                  <p>That is, it would be moſt heavy. Who can tell how heavy that is which is heavier then the heavieſt?</p>
                  <p>If my calamity (ſaith <hi>Job)</hi> were weighed, it would have been found heavier, than the ſand of the Sea, that account would be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of it; though you (my friend <hi>Eliphaz)</hi> ſeeme to account it as light as a feather.</p>
                  <p>The ſand of the Sea is applied three wayes in Scripture,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to ſet forth an exceeding great number, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 22. 17.) <hi>I will multiply thy ſeed as the Starres of the Heaven, and as the ſand which is upon the Sea ſhore.</hi> That is, I will exceedingly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply thy ſeed, thy children ſhall be not only numerous, but num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe; Though a book of <hi>Numbers</hi> be written concerning <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity, yet their totall number is not written. So <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 78. 27.) <hi>He rained fleſh upon them as duſt, and feathered fowles like as the ſand of the Sea,</hi> that is, he rained aboundance of feathered fowles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſand of the Sea, is uſed to expreſſe the largneſſe, the mighty extent or capacity of a thing; The ſand of the Sea, is of a vaſter extent, then the Sea it ſelf, as being the outward line or bound of it; therefore <hi>(Jer.</hi> 33. 22.) it is ſpoken of, as a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for the ſand of the ſea to be meaſured; <hi>As the hoſt of Heaven</hi>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:40455:216"/> 
                     <hi>(ſc.</hi> the Starres) <hi>cannot be numbred, neither the ſand of the Sea meaſured, ſo will I multiply the ſeed of my ſervant David.</hi> Meaſure is taken both of the content, and extent of things; The ſand of the Sea is immeaſurable both wayes, it cannot (as we ſpeak of humane impoſſibles) be meaſured by the pole or by the veſſell. And in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 29. it is ſaid, <hi>God gave</hi> Salomon <hi>wiſdome and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding exceeding much, and largeneſſe of heart as the ſand of the Sea,</hi> that is, as the ſand incompaſſes and takes the Sea in its armes, ſo <hi>Salomon</hi> had a heart, comprehending all the depths and oceans of knowledge; he had the compaſſe of all learning in his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Hence, when a man attempts a thing impoſſible, we ſay to him proverbially. <hi>Thou meaſureſt the ſand.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſand of the Sea is applied in Scripture, to note the exceeding weight and heavineſſe of a thing: that inſtance is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for it <hi>(Prov.</hi> 23. 7.) <hi>A ſtone is heavy, and the ſand is weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but a fooles wrath is heavier than both;</hi> when <hi>Salomon</hi> would <note place="margin">Stulti mores <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Afflictions are heavy burthens.</hi> The judgements of God upon wicked men, are frequently in Scripture called burthens, and they are heavy burthens; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15. 1. we read of the <hi>burthen of Moab,</hi>
                     <pb n="421" facs="tcp:40455:216"/> that is, the judgement and calamity that ſhould fall upon <hi>Moab;</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>The burden of Damaſcus.</hi> And Iſa. 19. 1. <hi>The burden of Egypt.</hi> And Iſa. 21. 1. <hi>The burden of the deſert of the Sea.</hi> And afterwards, <hi>The burden of the valley of viſion,</hi> that is of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> And (2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 25.) when <hi>Jehu</hi> had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jehoram,</hi> he ſaid to <hi>Bidkar</hi> his Captaine: <hi>Take up and caſt him in the portion of the field of</hi> Naboth <hi>the Jezreelite, for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how that when I and thou rode together after</hi> Ahab <hi>his father, the Lord laid this burden upon him;</hi> That is, that he ſhould be ſlaine and throwne out in this manner. As afflictions upon wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are burdens; So, afflictions upon the godly are burdens too, they are alſo heavy burdens: Their ſinnes are burdens upon them, <hi>My ſinnes</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) are gone over my head, they are a burthen too heavy for me to beare,</hi> Pſal. 38. 4. Their ſins are burdens and their ſorrowes are burdens. Sin doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burden man, but it burthens God, <hi>I am preſſed under your ſinnes, as a cart is preſſed, that is full of ſheaves,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 13. As man, by ſin burthens God, ſo God, by affliction burthens man. But of all afflictions, inward afflictions are the greateſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: As the ſpirit of a man is ſtronger then his fleſh, ſo the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which are upon his ſpirit are weightier then thoſe that are upon his fleſh: The ſpirit hath wonderfull ſtrength, all ſpirits are ſtrong: Angells are mighty in ſtrength, <hi>One good Angel is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-match for all men.</hi> And the devils (who are ſpirits) are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not not only <hi>Principalities but powers,</hi> becauſe of their ſtrength. Proportionably, the ſpirit of man hath a mighty ſtrength in it, and ſo the afflictions, which are upon the ſpirit, may have a greater weight in them. The affliction which <hi>Job</hi> complains of, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier then the ſand, was not ſo much the calamity that preſſed his fleſh, or the paine that tormented his body (as is plaine in the next verſe) but it was the calamity of his ſpirit, the affliction lying there, <hi>A man can ſuſtaine his infirmity, but a wounded ſpirit,</hi> (that is, when a man hath got a blow, a wound, an affliction upon his ſpirit) <hi>who can beare? Pro.</hi> 18. 14. As if <hi>Salomon</hi> had ſaid, I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all the world to find me out a man, that can bear a burdened wounded ſpirit; unleſſe Chriſt put under his hand, no ſtrength of mans ſpirit can bear the burthen of a wounded ſpirit; A ſpirit hath no weight at all, only fleſhly and materiall ſubſtances are ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; but a wounded ſpirit is heavier then wounded fleſh. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſtrong enough to beare the burthen'd fleſh, but nothing in fleſh can beare a burthen'd ſpirit.</p>

As a man that ſwallowes down a morſell greedily without chewing, never taſtes either the ſweetneſſe or the bitterneſſe of it. It is a uſuall Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor. to expreſſe hearing by eating; and we have it (as many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret) at the ſixth verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Can that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury be eaten without ſalt.</hi> It is a truth, that when words are thus ſwallowed or gobled downe, we take not out the ſtrength or intent of them. But I ſtay not upon this expoſition, becauſe it ſtrains too hard upon the grammaticall conſtruction, and other circumſtances, of the Text.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve out of the former meaning.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Great griefe interrupteth speech, and makes broken language; Therefore my speech or my words are ſwallowed up.</hi> As ſometimes our words devoure ſo ſometimes our words are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; ſome men ſpeake ſwallowing words, and others ſwallow their words, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 57. 4.) <hi>Thou loveſt all devouring words, or thou lovest all ſwallowing words, O thou deceitfull tongue.</hi> There are ſwallowing words, as well as ſwallowed words.

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:40455:218"/> ſpeake to maintaine his own integrity.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, For the word of God, Pſal 4. 5. <hi>Thine arrowes are ſharpe in the heart of the Kings enemies, whereby the people fall under thee.</hi> That is, thy words are ſharpe and peircing, whereby thou convinceſt and beateſt downe ſin and ſinners, either converting or deſtroying them. The Rider on the white Horſe, going out conquering and to conquer (who, is conceived to be, Truth, or the word of God triumphing) is deſcribed, with a Bowe in his hand; <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Arrows are put for the bitter and reproachfull words of men, Pſ. 64. 3. 4. &amp; Pſ. 120. 4. <hi>They bend their bowes to ſhoot their arrows, even bitter words.</hi>
                  </p>

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:40455:219"/> intends or aimes to the hurt of his brother, Pſal. 58. 7. <hi>When he bendeth his bow to ſhoot his arrowes, let them be as cut in peeces.</hi> Bending of the bow notes the preparing and ſetting of miſchiefe; The arrow ſhot out of this bent bowe, is the miſchiefe acted and finiſhed (Pſal. 2.) <hi>The wicked bend their bowe, they make ready their arrow upon the ſtring;</hi> they prepare miſchiefs againſt their neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly For any kind of affliction, judgement or puniſhment, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 14. And <hi>the Lord ſhall be ſeene over them, and his arrow ſhall goe forth as the lightning.</hi> Particularly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Famine, Ezek. 5. 16. <hi>When I ſhall ſend upon them the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill arrowes of famine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 For Peſtilence, Pſal. 91. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be affraid for the terrour by nigbt, nor for the arrow that fleeth by day.</hi> What the terrour and the arrow are, is explained in the next verſe, which is not an addition of other evils, from which ſafety is promiſed, but an explication of the ſame. <hi>The peſtilence that walks in darkneſſe, and the deſtruction</hi> (being the ſame peſtilence) <hi>waſting at noone-day.</hi> The meaning of all is, Thou ſhalt be kept or antidoted againſt the plague both night and day.</p>

                  <p>Further the arrows of God ſignifie inward afflictions, troubles of the mind and ſpirit, God often ſhoots an arrow, which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the very ſoule.

And therefore the Martyrs, when all was wound in their fleſh, ſpoke and triumph'd, becauſe their ſpirits were whole, and untoucht. Onely a ſpirit can ſhoot arrowes into our ſpirits.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Further, There is a two-fold terrour: Firſt, cauſed by outward imminent danger. Secondly, cauſed by inward guilt.

Thus it was threatned, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>I alſo will doe even this unto you, I will appoint over you terrours.</hi> Deut. 32. 25. <hi>The ſword without and terrour within, ſhall deſtroy both the young man and the virgin.</hi> That is, feare ſhall kill thoſe who eſcape the ſword.

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, The terrours of God afflict the ſoule; Firſt, When ſin is ſet openly (to the eye of conſcience) in array againſt us. <hi>An army of ſins, are an army of terrours.</hi> The Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Terrible as an army with banners; Cant.</hi> 6. 10. when ſhe is ſtrengthned and armed for the exerciſe of all that power, which Chriſt hath given her; and when our ſins ſtand before us, in all that ſtrength, which the law hath given them, they alſo are <hi>terrible as an army with banners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When God hides his face from us, an army of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours quickly faces us; Though an army of ſins come out in array againſt us, yet if God appear to us, in the fulneſſe and freeneſſe of his grace; if Chriſt our Captaine will but leade us on againſt this army, we ſhall quickly overcome them, or they will will fly before us; But an army of ſins is exceeding terrible, when Chriſt appears not in the field for us, or when God hides his face from us, and leaves us in the dark: It is uſuall in Scripture, to ſet forth terrours, as the effect of that darkneſſe, and the hidings of the face of God; Naturally, terrour accompanies dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; children are afraid in the dark; and not onely children, but men: Hiſtories tell us of great Emperours who durſt not be in the dark, for fear. And as naturall terrours meet us in naturall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo ſpirituall terrours in ſpirituall darkneſſe; <hi>When the light</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, To the ordering of ſpeech, or diſputations; There is a kind of embattailing in diſputation, when it is regular and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <hi>(Job</hi> 32. 14) <hi>Now he hath not directed his ſpeech againſt me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> concerning <hi>Job;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> hath not marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled his arguments againſt me, but all the charge hath been upon you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I find the word uſed in reference unto prayer: Prayer ought to be full of holy order and compoſedneſſe <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 5. 3.) <hi>In the morning will I direct my prayer to Thee, and looke up.</hi> In the morning will I put my prayer in array, I will poſture my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a gratious order, my heart in order, and my words in order, every petition ſhall (as it were) keep ranke and file, when I am ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto God: <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be haſty, to utter any thing before God,</hi> is the counſell of the Holy Ghoſt by <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 2.</p>

                  <p>Theſe arrowes and terrours are often preparatorie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; when ſome men are overcome to receive Chriſt, an Army of terrours is ſent out, to take them captive, and bring them in. There are many (I grant) whom God wounds with love, he ſhootes an arrow of favour into their hearts, and overcomes them with Troopes of mercies. Againe, An army of terrours, is ſent out to try the holy courage of thoſe, who are converted, as well as to conquer the unholy enmity of perſon: unconverted.

                  <p>Few beleeve this, but they who have had experience of it. <hi>As the joyes of the ſpirit, ſo the terrours of the spirit, are ſecrets unto moſt;</hi> As the Prophet ſpeakes concerning thoſe carnall ones in his time; <hi>If one propheſie unto them of wine and ſtrong drinke, he ſhall even be the Prophet of this people.

So, on the other ſide, if you would be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or ſpeake, or preach to ſome of fire and ſword, of ſpoiling and plundering their eſtates, preach to them of plague and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, preach to them of the gout, and of the ſtone, of burning fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and languiſhing conſumptions; they underſtand theſe and are afraid, they even tremble to heare you ſpeake of theſe things: but preach to them of the arrowes of the Almighty, ſhot into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of the terrours of God ſet in array againſt them; preach to them of trouble of conſcience, and the hiding of Gods face, they ſmile at theſe things, they wonder what you would have, they know no ſuch matters. <hi>Spirituall good or evill, is ſeldome knowne till felt, yea neither of them is knowne</hi> (to purpoſe) <hi>till it is felt:</hi> Spirituall troubles are as little knowne, till felt, as ſpirituall joyes are: The naturall man perceives none of the things of God, he cannot know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned: And there is as much ſpiritualneſſe evidenced in diſcerning ſpirituall ſorrowes and afflictions (our own or others) as there is in diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our own or others ſpirituall joyes and conſolations.</p>

Take heed of complaining without cauſe; if beaſts are ſatisfied with what is agreeable to nature, man ſhould be ſo much more, <hi>When Nature hath not enough, Grace hath all.</hi> Grace will not bray or low, when there is no graſſe, no fodder: ſurely then they have a ſcarcity of grace in their hearts, who bray and low over their graſs and fodder. Spirituall accommodations will make a good heart forget temporall incommodities; and it is reaſon they ſhould God promiſeth (Iſa. 30. 20.) <hi>Though I give you the bread of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and the water of affliction, yet thy teachers ſhall no more be removed into a corner, but thine eyes ſhall ſee thy teachers.</hi> As if he had ſaid, though your bodies are courſely fed, yet your ſouls ſhall be feaſted; Good cheare ſhal daily be ſerved into them, both at your eyes and eares, <hi>Thine eyes ſhall ſee thy teachers and thou ſhalt heare a voice behind thee.</hi> Thy ſight and thy hearing ſhall be refreſhed with heavenly Meſſengers and good news from heaven Now beſides this promiſe expreſt, there is a duty implyed in the text, namely, that becauſe their ſpirits were ſo well fed, therfore they muſt not complain, though their fleſh come ſhort in feeding. <hi>The bread of affliction ſhould be pleaſant to us, while we eate Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainties.</hi> In theſe times God gives more plenty of ſpirituall food than formerly, yet many complaine, becauſe their naturall bread is ſhortned; Remember beaſts complaine not, when they have what is ſuitable to nature, then let not Chriſtians complaine, when they have what is ſuitable to grace, though nature have but ſpare diet, and ſhort commons.</p>

                  <q>Can that which is unſavorie.</q>
                  <p>The word, which we render <hi>unſavorie,</hi> is the ſame uſed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. which wee there opened at large; Job <hi>did not charge God with folly or fooliſhly,</hi> or he ſpake not unſavorily of God.</p>
                  <p>There is a threefold application of that word in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To unpleaſant meats.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To untempered morter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To indiſcreet ſpeeches, which want the ſeaſoning either of wit, wiſdome, or of truth, Lam. 2. 14. <hi>Thy Prophets have ſeene vaine and fooliſh things for thee;</hi> Lying viſions without truth, vain words without wiſdome. So here, <hi>Can that which is unſavourie be eaten without ſalt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seaſoning makes unſavory things ſweet; <hi>As ſalt gives a reliſh to meat, ſo wiſdome and wit to words.</hi> And therefore the Latines ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wiſe, witty ſpeeches, pleaſant diſcourſe, a good grace in ſpeaking, and a <hi>ſalt,</hi> by the ſame word.</p>
                  <p>There is another Interpretation of that word, which we render b <hi>without:</hi> for ſome underſtand it, not as a Prepoſition, governing the word <hi>Salt,</hi> but as a compound word, noting the oldneſſe or ſtaleneſſe of meat, wherein the very ſalt it ſelfe is putrified; and ſo whereas we ſay, <hi>Can that which is unſavoury be eaten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſalt?</hi> They tranſlate thus, <hi>Can that which is unſavoury through the corruption of ſalt be eaten?</hi> Or, can that meat be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which having been ſalted, is now putrified? <hi>Salt which keeps meat from corruption, may in time be overcome with the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the meat.</hi> And a learned Interpreter gives the reaſon why he rather chuſeth this interpretation of the word, becauſe (ſaith he) it carries a ſtronger <hi>Emphaſis</hi> with it; <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes as of a thing (in a manner) unpoſſible to be done; Now it is very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to eat unſavoury meat, without ſalt? A good appetite will downe with unpleaſant food, and hunger will diſpence much with Cookery. But when ſeaſon'd or ſalted meat corrupts and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, whoſe ſtomach doth not loath and abhorre it? Therefore it is a fuller, and a more flat deniall to ſay, <hi>Can that which is unſavoury</hi>

                     <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are now my ſorrowfull meate,</hi> or, <hi>the meate of my ſorrow;</hi> The termes of the latter clauſe are at fartheſt diſtance from, and oppoſition with that which went before. Not to touch a thing, notes the greateſt averſation from it; and to have a thing given us as meate, notes our greateſt communion with it. That which a man will not touch with his finger, how farre is he from chewing it between his teeth, or letting it downe into his ſtomach, and digeſting it into himſelfe? So that <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning ſeemes to be this, that, what he deſired to be the greateſt ſtranger from, was now offered to his neereſt familiarity and acquaintance. He was now (as it were) to eate, what before he would not touch,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:40455:228"/> This we call <hi>ſorrowfull meat.</hi> Pſal. 127. 2.

                  <p>That relative <hi>(the Things)</hi> is not in the Hebrew, and ſo we may render word for word thus, <hi>my ſoule refuſed to touch them as my ſorrowfull meate.</hi> Or as another, <hi>My mind refuſes to touch them; theſe are plainly, the very ſickneſſe of my meate.</hi> As if he had ſaid: I am ſo farre, from being refreſhed with theſe that (the truth is) they make my very meate, and ſo my whole life unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to me.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> varies the latter clauſe: <hi>Thoſe things which I have loathed to touch, are now the very ſickneſſe of my fleſh.</hi> The word <hi>(Lechem)</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>meat,</hi> or <hi>prepared fleſh,</hi> ſignifies alſo <hi>living fleſh,</hi> in the <hi>Syriacke</hi> and <hi>Arabique</hi> langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as the learned Grammarians obſerve: Beſides, we render the word <hi>(Lechem) fleſh,</hi> Zeph. 1. 17. <hi>Their blood ſhall be powred out as duſt, and their fleſh as dung,</hi> Hence he tranſlates, <hi>Theſe things are to me as the ſickneſſe of my fleſh;</hi> That is, the things which my ſoule refuſed to touch, are now brought very neere, and laid cloſe upon me, as ſickneſſe or ſoares cleave unto, and are in the fleſh, or they trouble me as much as the ſickneſſe of my fleſh.</p>
                  <p>The right application of theſe words, is as difficult as the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of them; there are divers wayes to make out the ſence; I ſhall reduce them unto two: Either, firſt, That all theſe unſavoury, taſtleſſe, ſorrowfull meates; which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of, are but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of his afflictions and troubles, received from the hand of God.

The Lord threatens the nice delicate dames of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with ſuch things, as their proud ſpirits and naughty ſoules refuſed to touch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of ſweet ſmell, there ſhall be a ſtinke; and inſtead of a girdle, a rent; and in ſtead of well ſet haire, baldneſſe; and inſtead of a ſtomacher, a girding with ſackcloath; and burning inſtead of beauty.</hi> Take heed of coyneſſe and curioſity: many a dainty tooth hath been taught by hunger, to knaw bones, and water for a cruſt of bread.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve ſecondly, <hi>That which makes afflictions moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to us, is the unſuitableneſſe of our spirits to afflictions: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and content, conſiſt in ſuitableneſſe of the object to our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and deſires.</hi> God offers ſpirituall food to the naturall man, but his ſoule refuſes to touch it; he loathes Angels food, and is weary of the manna of the word; The precious Goſpel, the bread of life, is an affliction to him, becauſe his heart is unſutable to it; how will ſuch be afflicted at the laſt, when they find, <hi>That,</hi> as their ſorrowfull meate for ever, which their ſouls will for ever refuſe to touch.

His counſels, in the doctrine of them; were good and ſavoury, he ſpake wholeſome food; but as to <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, he was quite miſtaken in their uſe: and ſo inſtead of eaſing, troubled him. A Phyſitian may give his ſick patient; that which is good in it ſelfe, very cordiall and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, and yet it may kill him inſtead of curing him, if it be not proper for his body, and his diſeaſe.

                  <p>IN the former part of this Chapter, we have had <hi>Job</hi> defending his former complaint of life, and his deſire of death. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, from the 8th verſe, unto the end of the 12th, he reneweth and reinforceth that deſire. He not only maintaines and juſtifies what he had done, but doth it again; begging for death as heartily and importunately, as he did in the third Chapter, <hi>O that I might have my requeſt! and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The requeſt it ſelfe, is laid downe in the 8<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> and 9<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> verſes: and the reaſons ſtrengthning it, in the 10, 11, and 12, verſes. So, theſe 5 verſes are reduceable to theſe two heads;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The renewing of his deſire to dye.</item>
                     <item>2. An enlargement of reaſons confirming that deſire.</item>
                  </list>
                  <q>O that I might have my requeſt!</q>
                  <p>It is ſuch a vehement deſire, and ſo expreſt, as <hi>Davids</hi> was, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>longed, and ſaid, Oh that one would give me drinke of the water of the well of Bethlem, which is by the gate. David</hi> did not long more to taſt a cup of that water, then <hi>Job</hi> did to taſt the cup of death.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme and ſcope of <hi>Jobs</hi> thoughts in this paſſage, may be conceived thus. He would aſſure his friends, that his faith was firme, and his comforts flowing from it, very ſweet; That, it was not impatience under the troubles of this life, but aſſurance of the
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:40455:231"/> comforts of the next; which cauſed him ſo often to call for death. That, theſe comforts cauſed his heart to triumph and glory in the very approaches of the moſt painfull death, and made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, and lightly to eſteeme all the hopes of life. That, he was gone further then the motives which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> uſed, from the hopes of a reſtitution to temporall happineſſe: he now was pitcht upon, and lodg'd in the thoughts of eternall happineſſe. That, he call'd for death, not, as that, with which he had made any Covenant, or was come to any agreement with, but only, as that, which would bring him to <hi>his deſired home, The one Thing he deſired.</hi> That his comforts had not a foundation in a grave, where <hi>all things are forgotten,</hi> but in the Covenant of God, <hi>who remembers mercy for ever;</hi> and therefore, it ſhould not trouble him, to die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was reſtored to health, riches and honour (which his friends propoſed to him, as a great argument of comfort, and of patience) For in death he ſhould have riches and glory; and hence it was, that he had rather endure the extreameſt paines of death, then ſtay to receive any outward comforts in this life. His deſires to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, were not ſo much, from the ſence of his preſent paine (for he would harden himſelfe to endure, yet more) as from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of future joy; This, was not a fancie or a dreame, but he had good proof, and reall evidence of it in the whole courſe of his life which had been as a continued acting of the word of God, and to a fitting him for neareſt communion with God. This in general.</p>
                  <p>The letter of the Hebrew runneth thus, <hi>Who would give me, that my requeſt, or that my petition might come.</hi> He had ſent up a requeſt, a prayer, a prayer for death, and he thought his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er too long gone upon that meſſage; Prayer was not quick enough in its returne from Heaven, every houre was a yeare till he heard of it, therefore (ſaith he) <hi>O that ſome body would give me, that my requeſt might come back againe unto me!</hi> The word whereby <note place="margin">

                     </note> he expreſſes his requeſt, notes a very ſtrong deſire, a ſtrong cry, a ſtrong prayer; implying, that <hi>Job</hi> had ſent up mighty requeſts, or ſtrong cries about it. As it is ſaid of our <hi>Lord Christ, Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>That in the dayes of his fleſh, he ſent up ſtrong cryes unto God, who was able to deliver him;</hi> Chriſt ſent up ſtrong cryes to be delivered from death, and <hi>Job</hi> ſent up ſtrong cryes for death. A word of the ſame root, ſignifies the grave; the grave is a craving, a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thing; the grave is never ſatisfied, as it is in the <hi>Proverbs, The grave ſaith not, it is enough:</hi> And the grave is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:40455:232"/> by a word that ſignifies to deſire, or requeſt, or to ask a thing importunately; becauſe, the grave, hath a mouth, as it were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually open to ask, and beg, and cry out for more morſells, it conſumeth all, and is never full; ſuch a deſire <hi>Job</hi> put forth for death.</p>
                  <q>And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</q>
                  <p>It is a repetition of the ſame deſire, in other words. What it is to <hi>long,</hi> hath been opened in the third Chapter, ver. 21. <hi>Who long for death:</hi> Here <hi>Job</hi> reneweth the ſame ſuit againe, <hi>O that I might have the thing that I long for!</hi> or the thing which I expect with great expectation and vehemency of affection. I ſhall not ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: But only give you the generall ſence a little varied.</p>
                  <p>In this paſſage, <hi>Job</hi> ſhewes himſelfe aſſured, that his comforts ſhould not end, though his life ended, before he was reſtored to earthly comforts.

                  <p>Obſerve then in how ſad a condition, <hi>Job</hi> was, who not onely makes, but renewes ſuch a requeſt, as this.

Job</hi> ſpake once, and he ſpeakes it over again; O that I might die, yea he wooes deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and is an importunate ſuiter for the grave. <hi>How ſad is a mans outward condition, when he hath only this complaint left, that he cannot die? when a man hath no helpe, but in deſtruction, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling but in a deeper wound? Job</hi> in this appeares like a man (that is to be preſſed to death) lying under a heavy weight, yet the weight not heavy enough to cruſh him to death, he cries out, <hi>more weight, more weight.</hi> It will be a kindneſſe to cruſh out my
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:40455:233"/> breath and bowels; the greateſt favour I expect in this world, is, but to have more weight laid upon them, that I may die. Some of the Martyrs, when the fire was ſcant, have cried out, <hi>more fire.</hi> The cruelleſt flame was their friend, and the more the fire raged the more merciful it was to them. The book of our Martyrs reports of <hi>reverend Latimer,</hi> that when he was giving witneſſe to the truth, and glorifying the name of Chriſt in the fire; he cried out, <hi>Oh, I cannot burne,</hi> the fire came not faſt enough upon him.

                     <hi>If God put out his power, no creature can ſtand before it.</hi> If God doe but let looſe his hand, man is cut off preſently; It is but as a little twigge, or as graſſe before the ſith, or before a ſword, there is no more in it. As when <hi>God openeth the hand of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; he ſatisfieth the deſire of every living thing,</hi> Pſal. 145. 2. <hi>So when God looſeth the hand of his judgements, he takes away the life and comforts of every living thing.</hi> God hath a hand full of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and mercies; if he pleaſe but to open that hand, all things are filled with comfort: God hath another hand full of judgments and afflictions; if he open or looſen that, all creatures fall before
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:40455:234"/> him, like a withered leafe. The reaſon why the enemies of God live and are mighty, is becauſe God doth not fully looſen his hand againſt them: if he would but unpriſon his power, and let out his hand, he can with eaſe deſtroy, and cut them off in a moment. Therefore the prophet prayes but for this one thing, Pſalm. 74. 11. <hi>That God would pluck his hand out of his boſome; why with draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy boſome:</hi> Lord (ſaith he) this is the reaſon, why enemies yet prevail, thy hand is tyed up, that is, Thine owe act hath tyed up thy hand, thy will ſtayes thy power, or thy power is hid in thy will. <hi>Gods power kept in by his will, is his hand in his boſome.</hi> Among men, a hand in the boſome, is the embleme of ſloth, <hi>Prov,</hi> 19 24. Man hides his hand in his boſome, becauſe he will not be at the paines to worke: God is ſaid to hide his hand in his boſome, when it is not his will and pleaſure to work: therefore he ſaith: Lord, if thou wouldeſt but let looſe, and put out thy hand, all mine enemies ſhall be conſumed. And that's the reaſon, why there are ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpenſations of providence in theſe times; when the enemy prevailes, God with draweth his hand, he keepeth his hand in his boſome. And when at any time his ſervants have victorie, it is, becauſe his hand hath liberty. If God holds his hand, men ſtretch forth theirs in vain.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was not any Stoical apathy, or ignorant regardleſſeneſſe of life which raiſed the heart of <hi>Job</hi> to theſe deſires. He did not invite his end, like a <hi>Roman,</hi> or a philoſopher, or by the height and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of naturall courage, ſet the world at nought, and bid defiance to deſtruction. But he had laid up a good foundation againſt this day; upon this he builds his confidence. He knew, as <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had Chriſt, while he lived, and ſhould have gaine when he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The joy which was ſet before him made him over-look the croſſe which was before him. So much of his requeſt, now he tels us the conſequence, or effect it would have upon him, in caſe it were granted.</p>
                  <q>Verſ. 10. <hi>Then ſhould I yet have comfort, yet I would harden my ſelfe in ſorrow; Let him, not ſpare, for I have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the words of the holy One,</hi>

                  <p>If I had but this ſuit granted, I were refreſhed, notwithſtanding all my ſorrows, the very hope of death would revive me. Nothing doth ſo much refreſh the ſoule, as the hearing of a Prayer, and the grant of a deſire; <hi>when deſire cometh it is as a tree of life</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi> therefore <hi>Job</hi> might well ſay, when my longing comes, I ſhall have comfort; and leſt any ſhould think, that as <hi>David</hi> would not drinke the water he ſo longed for, when it was brought unto him: So when the cup of death ſhould be brought to <hi>Job,</hi> he might put it off ſomewhat upon thoſe termes which <hi>David</hi> did, and ſay, I will not drinke it, for it is my bloud, my death: therefore he adds,</p>
                  <q>Yea, I would harden my ſelf in ſorrow.</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid, though ſome call haſtily for death, and repent with as much haſte, when death comes, yet not I, I <hi>would harden my ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi>

                     </note> Scripture. And hence there is a three-fold interpretation of theſe words, I would harden my ſelfe in ſorrow, It ſignifies,</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>According to the firſt ſenſe, the text is rendred thus, <hi>Then ſhould I yet have comfort, yea, I would pray in my ſorrow,</hi> that is, I would pray yet more, for an increaſe of my ſorrow, that I might be cut off: If I had any hope, that my requeſt ſhould be granted, this hope would quicken my deſire, and I would pray yet more, that I might obtain it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the word ſignifies to warm or to heat, the ſenſe is given thus, <hi>Then ſhould I have comfort, yea I would warm my ſelfe in my ſorrow:</hi> And ſo it refers it to thoſe refreſhings, which his languiſhing ſoul, his ſoul chilled, as it were, with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſorrows, ſhould receive, upon the news of his approaching death.

But, beſides a warming or a refreſhing heat, the word alſo notes ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:40455:235"/> burning heat. <hi>Mr. Broughton</hi> takes that ſignification of the word; I ſhall touch that, and his ſence upon it, by and by.</p>
                  <p>We tranſlate according to the third uſage of the word. <hi>I would harden my ſelf;</hi> and ſo the conſtruction is very fair, <hi>I ſhould yet have comfort, yea, I would harden my ſelf in ſorrow,</hi> that is, I would now ſet my ſelfe to endure the greateſt ſorrowes and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which could come upon me, for the deſtroying and cutting off the threed of my life.

Or, take it in Maſter <hi>Broughtons</hi> owne gloſſe, <hi>in all theſe pangs; if God would make an end of me, it ſhould be my comfort, and I would take courage in my ſickneſſe to beare it, by my joy, that I ſhould die, becauſe I profeſſed the Religion of God.</hi> So that the ſtrength of <hi>Job,</hi> to bear the hand of God, was from the conſcience of his former integrity, in doing the will, and maintaining the truth of God.</p>

                  <p>

                     </note> and this reſolution, that he would harden himſelfe in ſorrow, ſpeaks now, as if he were at a point, let God doe what he pleaſeth, let him not ſpare; as if he had ſaid, what courſe ſoever the Lord ſhall ſee good to take for the cutting me off, I am content he ſhould goe on with it, <hi>Let him not ſpare.</hi> The word ſignifies to indulge or ſhew mercy to him, whom, by all right a man might juſtly deſtroy (Ezek. 5. 11.) <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done thus and thus, ſaith God therefore will I alſo diminiſh thee, neither ſhall mine eye ſpare, neither will I have any pity. Job</hi> ſeemes to invite, what God threatens others, <hi>Let him not ſpare, let him not have any pity, let him take his full ſwing in deſtroying of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this ſence it is ſaid, Rom. 8. 32. <hi>That God ſpared not his own ſonne:</hi> That is he abated not any thing, which juſtice could inflict. Chriſt therefore ſaves to the uttermoſt, becauſe he ſuffered to the uttermoſt. He was not ſpared one blow, one drop, one ſigh, one ſorrow, one ſhame, one circumſtance of all, or any one of theſe; which juſtice could demand, as a ſatisfaction for mans ſinne. Yea though (in a ſence) he cryed to his father, that he might be ſpared yet he was not.</p>
                  <p>There is a three-fold mercy in God. There is a preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, mercy that ſteps between us and trouble. And there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering mercy, mercy that takes us out of the hand of trouble: There is a third kinde of mercy, coming in the middle of theſe two, and that is called ſparing mercy: and that is two-fold; Firſt; ſparing for the time, when God delaies and ſtaies long ere he ſtrike.</p>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:40455:237"/>
                  <p> Secondly, ſparing for the degree, when the Lord moderates and mitigates, abates and qualifies our ſufferings, not letting them fall ſo heavie upon us, as they might: This ſparing mercy, ſtands (I ſay) in the middle of the two former; it is not ſo much as preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mercy, ſtopping trouble that it come not; neither is it ſo much as delivering mercy, removing it, when it is come. Now <hi>Job</hi> did not only, not aske delivering mercy, that he asked not ſparing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; Let him not ſpare me in the time, let him not delay or looſe time, let him come as ſoone as he will. And let him not ſpare me in the degree and meaſure, let him ſtrike me as hard, and lay his hand as heavily upon me, as he will. <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 39. 13.) makes this his requeſt, <hi>O ſpare me that I may recover ſtrength, before I goe hence, and be no more;</hi> That is, abate and mitigate my ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings that I die not, but <hi>Job</hi> deſireth not to be ſpared at all. He rather ſaith, take away all my ſtrength, that I may goe hence, and be ſeen no more. Obſerve hence,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the hope troubles will end, comforteth, yea hardneth in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent troubles.</hi> Then will I comfort my ſelfe then will <hi>I</hi> harden my ſelfe, let him not ſpare, if I may have my requeſt, and die. The ſharpeſt ſting of trouble, is, that it is endleſs, and it is next to that, when we can not looke to the end of it, nor ſee any iſſue or way out of it; That which diſcourages the damned, in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their ſorrowes, and ſoftens both their fleſh and ſpirits, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive home to the head, every arrow of wrath, and dart of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, is, they ſee no end, and are aſſured there will be none. They know, they cannot be cut off, and therefore they cannot har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelves in ſorrow; no, that very conſideration, makes their hearts, which have been hardned to commit ſin, tender to receive puniſhment, and exactly ſencible of their pains; could they ſee, that at laſt they ſhould be cut off, even they would be hardned to bear the torments of Hell, in the meane time, though that time ſhould be very long, yea as long as time can be, onely not endleſſe. The pain it ſelfe, doth not afflict ſo much, as the thought that they ſhall be afflicted for ever: As the aſſurance, that the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall never end, infinitely ſweetnes it; ſo the aſſurance that the paines of hell ſhall never end, infinitely ſharpens them: And not to ſee the ending of worldly troubles neer, puts us further off from comfort, then the bearing of thoſe troubles. Therefore ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> if I might be aſſured, that God would cut me off I would harden my ſelfe in ſorrow, and let not God ſpare; I would not deſire him

                  <p>In theſe words, <hi>Job</hi> gives the reaſon, or an account of his renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prayer and requeſt to die. As the deſire of <hi>Job</hi> was ſtrong and paſſionate, ſo likewiſe it was well grounded. He had a very high reaſon, an excellent ground, upon which he bottom'd this requeſt to die: His reaſon was ſpirituall, and therefore ſtrong. He beggs to be delivered from the troubles of his life, though by a painfull death, becauſe he was clear in himſelfe, that he had led a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe life.

                  <p>But may not we conceal the words of the moſt high? it is ſaid of <hi>Mary,</hi> that <hi>ſhe hid the words of Chriſt in her heart</hi> and of <hi>David, that he hid the commandements of God in his heart,</hi> Pſal. 119. 11. Did not the <hi>wiſe merchant hide the treaſure,</hi> namely Goſpel truth <hi>(Math.</hi> 13. 44.) <hi>as ſoon as he had found it?</hi> It ſhould ſeem all theſe concealed the word of God; how then is it that <hi>Job</hi> improves this, as a ſpeciall point of comfort, that he had not
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:40455:238"/> 
                     <hi>concealed the words of the holy One?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a double hiding, or concealement of the truth. There is firſt a hiding from danger; Secondly a hiding from uſe. There is a hiding to keep a thing ſafe, that others ſhall not take it from us; and there is a hiding to keep a thing cloſe, that others may not take the benefit of it, with us. When it is ſaid, that <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and the wiſe Merchant hid the word of God, it was, leſt they themſelves ſhould loſe it, leſt any ſhould deprive them of it, they hid it from danger: They layed it up as a treaſure in their hearts; but they did not hide it from the knowledge, or uſe of others; and that is it which <hi>Job</hi> affirmes of himſelfe, <hi>I have not concealed the words of the holy One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there are four wayes by which the word of God is ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hid or concealed, from all which <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to acquit himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, when we conceal the word of God by our own ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; when we know the word and truth of God, and yet we draw a vaile over them, by not revealing them: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul (Acts</hi> 20. 27.) acquits himſelf in this, to the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, I have not ſhunned to declare unto you the whole counſell of God;</hi> and <hi>verſe.</hi> 20. <hi>You know how I kept back nothing, that was profitable unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Silence to what is ſpoken, is conſent: and ſilence when we ſhould ſpeak, is concealement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a ſecond way of concealing the word of God, and that is by ſilencing others: Some conceale the words of the holy One themſelves, and they cannot endure that others ſhould publiſh them: The chiefe Prieſts and the Rulers <hi>(Acts</hi> 4 18.) <hi>charged</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>that they ſhould not ſpeake at all, nor teach any more in the name of Jeſus:</hi> They would ſtop the Apoſtles mouthes from ſpeaking the words of the holy One: Theſe keep the truth lockt up (as Chriſt charges the Lawyers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 52.) <hi>by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the key of knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a concealing of the word of God, under falſe gloſſes and miſinterpretations, or a hiding of it under errours and miſconſtructions; This is a very dangerous way of concealing the words of the holy One: The Phariſees made the law of God of none effect, by their expoſitions, as well as by their traditions, by the ſence they made of it, as well as by the additions they made unto it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The word of the holy One, may be concealed in our practiſe and converſations. The Apoſtle exhorts <hi>(Phil.</hi> 2. 16.) <hi>To hold forth the word of life in a pure converſation.</hi> The lives of
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:40455:239"/> Chriſtians ſhould publiſh the word of life. The beſt way of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the word, is by the praictſe of the word. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, who, by their unrighteous practiſes and ungodly converſations, impriſon, fetter, reſtrain and keep in the word: <hi>Mans holy life is the loudeſt Proclamation of the word of God. And a ſinfull life is the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> here acquits himſelfe from all theſe concealements; <hi>I have not e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ncealed the words of the holy One,</hi> either by my own ſilence, or by impoſing ſilence upon others, I have not concealed the word of the holy One, by my own corrupt gloſſes and interpretations, nor by a corrupt practiſe and converſation: I have deſired and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, that the whole word of God might be viſible in my actions, and audible in my ſpeeches, that I might walke cloathed, as it were, with the holy counſels and commandements of my God.</p>
                  <p>There is a reading of the words, different from this. Whereas we <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Malo potentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter exponi omnia: utinam, inquit, non par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret: Neque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim occultarem dicta ſancti, ſed ejus in me ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicarem &amp; laudarem.</hi> Merc.</note> ſay, <hi>I have not concealed the words of the holy One,</hi> that gives it thus, <hi>I would not conceale the words of the holy One,</hi> and ſo the word of the holy One, is taken, not for the truths of God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but for that ſpecial word of decree or ſentence which God ſhould paſſe out againſt him; A if he had ſaid. <hi>Let not God ſpare me, let him write <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s bitter a ſentence againſt me, as he pleaſeth, for my part, I would not conceale the, word of the moſt High, but I would publiſh his judgement and ſentence againſt me, yea I would praiſe him and extoll him for it.</hi> The vulgar Latine to this ſence, <hi>I would not contradict the word of the holy One;</hi> Let him not ſpare me, for as for my part, whatſoever God ſhall determine and reſolve, whatſoever word God ſhall ſpeake concerning me, I will never withſtand or open my mouth againſt it. This is a truth, and carries in it a high frame of holineſſe, when we can bring our hearts to this, that let God write as bitter things againſt us, as he pleaſeth, we will never contradict his word or decree, but our minds and ſpirits ſhall ſubmit wholly and fully to his diſpoſitions of us, and diſpenſations towards us: <hi>It is as clear an evidence of grace, to be paſſive under, as to be active in, the word of God. Not to contradict his writ, for our ſufferings, as not to conceale what he ſpeaks for our practiſe.</hi> But I rather ſtick to the former interpretation, <hi>Job</hi> giving this as a reaſon of his great confidence
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:40455:239"/> in purſuing his petition for death, becauſe he had been ſo ſincere, holding forth the word of God both in doctrine and in life.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we may obſerve from it. Firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the teſtimony of a good conſcience, is the beſt ground of our willingneſſe to die.</hi> That man ſpeakes enough for his willingneſſe to die, who hath lived ſpeaking and doing the will of God; and he is in a very miſerable caſe, who hath no other reaſon why he deſireth death, but onely becauſe he is in miſery. This was one, but not the only reaſon, why <hi>Job</hi> deſired death, he had a reaſon tranſcending this, <hi>I have not concealed the words of the holy One,</hi> and I know if, I have not concealed the word of God, God will not conceal his mercy and loving kindneſs from me. <hi>David</hi> bottoms his hopes of comfort in ſad times, upon this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 9, 10. <hi>I have preached righteouſneſs in the great Congregation, I have not refrained my lips O Lord thou knoweſt</hi> (he was not actively or politickly ſilent) <hi>I have not hid thy righteouſneſs within my heart</hi> (if lay there, but it was impriſoned or ſtifl'd there) <hi>I have declared thy faithfulneſs: and thy ſalvations I have not concealed thy loving kindneſs and thy truth, from the great Congregation.</hi> Upon this he fals a praying with a mighty ſpirit of beleeving, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord, let thy loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and thy truth continually preſerve me: for innumerable evils have compaſſed me about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The remembrance of our active faithfulneſs to the truth of God, will bear up our hearts in hoping for the mercy of God.</hi> He that in <hi>Davids,</hi> and in <hi>Jobs</hi> ſence can ſay, <hi>I have not concealed the words of the moſt high,</hi> may triumph over innumerable evils, and ſhall be <hi>more then a conquerer over the laſt and worſt of temporal evils, death. God cannot long conceal his love from them, who have not concealed his truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly obſerve, poſitively;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the counſels of God, his truths, muſt be revealed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath ſecrets which belong not to us, but then he puts them not forth in a word, nor writes them in his book; he keeps his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets cloſe in the cabinet of his decrees and counſels; but, what he reveals either in his word, or by his works, man ought to reveal too. It is as dangerous, if not more, to conceal what God hath made known, as to be inquiſitive to know what God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. Yea, it is as dangerous to hide the word of God, as it is to hide our own ſins. And we equally give glory to God, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

                     <hi>That it is a dangerous thing for any man to conceale the word of God, either in his opinion, or in his practice.</hi> For it is, as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid if I had ever concealed the words of God, I had bin but in an ill caſe, at this time; God might now juſtly reveale his wrath againſt me, if I had concealed his word from others; or God might juſtly hide his mercies from me, if I had hid his word from men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered truths, will one time or other ſet the conſcience in a flame,</hi> and that which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpake once, concerning his reſolution to conceale the word of God, and the effect of it: will be a truth upon every one, who ſhall ſet himſelfe under a reſolution to doe, what he under a temptation did; <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 9. <hi>Then I ſaid, I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeake any more in his name:</hi> what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes? <hi>Then his word was in my breaſt, as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing.</hi> If a gracious heart hath taken up ſuch a ſodaine reſolution to conceale the word of God, he quickly repents of it, or ſmarts under it: He findes that word, as a burning fire in his bones, he is not able to bear it. I <hi>was weary with forbearing</hi> (ſaith the prophet) <hi>Nothing in the world will burthen the conſcience, ſo much as concealed truth:</hi> and they who have taken a meditated reſolution, that they will not reveale the word of God, may be ſure, that word will one time or other reveale it ſelfe to them, in the Light and heat of a burning fire, ſeeding upon their conſciences.</p>

                     <hi>God,</hi> When you hear that Title, <hi>The holy One,</hi> you may know who is meant. This is a Title too bigge for any but a God; All holineſſe is in God, and God is ſo holy, that properly he onely is Holy; Hence the Scripture ſets God forth under this, as a peculiar attribute; <hi>The Holy One;</hi> The Prophets often uſe this addition or ſtile, <hi>The Holy One of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Holy One;</hi> Is <hi>One ſeparate or ſet apart from all filthineſſe</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Further, God is called <hi>The Holy One,</hi> in three reſpects. Firſt, <note place="margin">Deus vocatur Sanctus Iſrael vel Sanctus ſimpliciter, vel quod ſancté a nobis colendus eſt, vel quod i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſe ſolus vere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſanctus eſt.</note> Becauſe he is all holy in himſelf; Secondly, Becauſe we receive all holineſs from him: Thirdly, Becauſe we are to <hi>ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all our daies. A Holy God muſt have a holy Service.</hi> God is <hi>The Holy One;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, In his Nature; his eſſence is purity. Or, he is eſſential purity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is holy in his Word; thoſe are frequent adjuncts of the word of God; <hi>holy, pure and clean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is holy in his works: There is not the leaſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable ſtain or defilement upon any thing he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three put together, lift up the glory of God in this title <hi>The Holy One.</hi> He that is holy throughout in his nature, holy in his word, holy in his works, <hi>is the Holy One;</hi> Yea, he is, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtileth him in his triumphant ſong, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. <hi>Glorious in holineſſe, A glorious holy One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or again, We may conſider God <hi>The holy One;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Radically and fundamentally, becauſe the Divine nature is the root and original, the ſpring of all holineſſe and purity; All holineſſe is in God, and there is no holineſſe to be had, but in God alone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is <hi>The holy One,</hi> by way of <hi>example</hi> and patterne, or in regard of the rule and meaſure of holineſſe: (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16.) <hi>Be ye holy, as I am holy;</hi> the Holineſſe of God, it is the exemplar and patterne of all the holineſſe, that is in the creature.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God is <hi>The holy One,</hi> by way of <hi>motive;</hi> He is, as the rule of holineſſe, ſo likewiſe the reaſon of our holineſſe; therefore another Scripture ſaith, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> I am <hi>The holy One,</hi> and that is the reaſon, why you muſt be holy too.</p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:40455:241"/>
                  <p> Fourthly, God is, <hi>The holy one,</hi> effectively, becauſe he works, conveies and propagates all holineſs, to, and in the creature. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can frame a heart to holineſs, but the finger of God.</hi> Man can no more make himſelf, or another holy, than he can redeem ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, He is called, <hi>The holy One,</hi> by way of eminency or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-excellency; becauſe his holineſs is infinitely beyond all the holineſs of men and Angels. <hi>Angels are holy,</hi> and God is pleaſed to ſay of <hi>men,</hi> that they are <hi>holy,</hi> but not man, nor Angel, can be called, <hi>The holy One.</hi> His ſupereminency in holineſs ſhines forth in ſuch beams and rayes, as theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Holineſs in God it is not a quality, but, his eſſence. Holineſs in Angels is a quality, the eſſence of many Angels continues, though their holineſs be loſt and vaniſhed; the lapſed Angels, who are now devils, keep their nature, but their holineſs is gone; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holineſs was but a quality or accidental to them; So, in the Saints, holineſs is an infuſion, a quality, a grace; moſt men never had any holineſs, and the man would remain, though his holineſs ſhould be loſt. But in God, his eſſence and his holineſs are the ſame; <hi>The holineſs of God, It is the holy God,</hi> as the wiſdom of God, it is the wiſe God: and the power of God, it is the powerful God. <hi>The attributes of God, for our learning, are diſtinguiſhed from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but, in him they are the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is <hi>The holy One</hi> eminently, above men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, becauſe he is <hi>abſolutely perfect</hi> in holineſs. Abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: firſt, becauſe he is holy, extenſively (if we may ſo ſpeak of God) in all parts, he is holy <hi>throughout;</hi> and then, he is holy <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively,</hi> as he is holy in all parts, ſo he is altogether holy in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part. Holy men have holineſs in every part, yet they are holy but in part; and though Angels be holy in every part extenſively, and have alſo a perfection of holineſſe, yet they have not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection of holineſs; therefore Angels themſelves are <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable with folly,</hi> compared with God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 18. God is ſo <hi>light,</hi> that in him there is no darkneſs at all, he is ſo holy, in him, that, there is no unholineſs at all. But men, the beſt of men, all the ſaints upon earth, have darkneſs with their light, and unholineſs mixed with their holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the third place, the eminency of God in holineſs appeareth in this, that, God is ever equally holy, ever in the ſame degree and frame of holineſs: Angels are ſo too, becauſe they are
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:40455:241"/> confirmed; and though at the preſent, the Saints are not, yet, when Chriſt ſhall ſet them up, in that glorious eſtate, they ſhall keep the ſame frame for ever. But the Saints upon earth are unequally holy; For, firſt, they are growing, their eſtate here is an encreaſing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, they are more holy one year than another, as they grow more in knowledge, ſo in every grace: And then, in regard of the exerciſe, they are more holy at one time, than at another; which of the Saints hath not found, or doth not find much variety in his ſpirit. Now a heart enlarged in prayer, and anon ſtraightned, now a heart believing, and anon doubting; now humble, anon lifted up with pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as <hi>the holy One,</hi> is, perfectly and abſolutely holy, ſo, he is ever equally in the ſame degree, and tenor of holineſs, not the leaſt variety or ſhaddow of turning in him. Put all theſe together, and the title is clear, How God by an excellency is called, <hi>The holy One.</hi> As he is ſo ſtrong, that all the power of the creature, compared with his, is weakneſs, and ſo wiſe, that all the wiſdom of the creature compared with his, is folly: So he is ſo holy, that, compared with him, all holineſs, is unholy, and he alone, <hi>The holy One.</hi> Obſerve, hence,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That the holineſs of man conſiſts in his conformity unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Holineſs is our likeneſs to God, or the application of our minds and actions to God, as the Scholles define it. God, <hi>the holy One,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sanctitas dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur per quam mens ſeipſum &amp; ſuos actus applicat Deo,</note> is, (if we may ſo ſpeak) the ſtandard, the patern, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all holineſs. There is a two-fold conformity to God in holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a conformity to the nature of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a conformity to the will of God, or to that which God wills. Theſe make up the total holineſs of the creature.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Holineſs is our conformity to the nature of God. And therefore beleevers are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of the divine nature</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.) This participation, is our analogical reſemblance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the divine nature: Firſt, in his attributes. Secondly, in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. In his attributes, when we are patient, mercifull, juſt, faithful, true-loving, as God is. Theſe are the image of God in us, and by theſe God becomes (as it were) viſible in man. As thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of God, even his eternal power and God-head are ſeen in the things which are created, ſo thoſe, other inviſible things of God, even his eternal holineſſe and purity, are ſeen in thoſe, who are ſanctified. And in the ſame ſence that God ſpeaks of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:40455:242"/> in regard of his power depoſited in their hands. <hi>I have ſaid ye are gods,</hi> we alſo may ſay of all the faithfull, in regard of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe infuſed into their hearts, <hi>ye are gods;</hi> and as to live, or doe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, is (as the Apoſtle phraſeth it) to walk (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) as men, ſo to live and doe holily is in our ſphear to walke (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) as God. And as this holineſſe ariſes from a reſemblance of God in his Attributes, ſo in his Affections; when we love what God loves, when we hate, what God hates; when, what, pleaſes God pleaſeth us alſo; when, what provokes his Spirit, provokes ours. This is holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Holineſſe is our conformity to the will of God. That is, to whatſoever God wils us, either to doe, or not to doe. <hi>The will of God is the rule of holineſſe, as his nature is the patterne of it.</hi> His internall will, called by the Schoole-men, <hi>The will of his good</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Voluntas bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>pleaſure,</hi> is the firſtly-firſt rule (as they ſpeake) His externall will, or his will expreſſed and ſignified by his word, is the ſecondly-firſt rule of holineſſe. Every action of man is holy or unholy according to it's conformity with, or variation from this will. There is no more holineſſe in any worke, then there is of the will of God in any work; to doe holily and to doe the will of God are the ſame <hi>David</hi> a holy man is deſcribed by both theſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>I have found</hi> David, <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>A man after mine owne heart,</hi> ther's conformity to the will of God: which ſhall fulfill all my will, there's conformity to the will of God, the reſult of both is holineſſe. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sicut impuritas naſcitur ex non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actu inferiorum, ut cum facies aut veſtis luto aſpergitur vel cum anima per affectus inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus inordinatè inhaeret; I a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas oritur ex contactu ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum cum af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus ad ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miora &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilicra aſſurgit, &amp; ijs inhaerit.</hi> Leſſ <hi>de perfect.</hi> Div. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unholineſſe and impurity ariſe from our conformity or adheſion to thoſe things, which are unclean and unholy. In externals and corporals if a mans hand or his garment touch an uncleane thing he hath the marke or impreſſion of that uncleaneſſe upon his hand or upon his garment; and this likeneſſe to an unclean thing, makes his hand or garment uncleane. So for inward uncleanneſſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment, when the ſoule inordinately cleaves, and the minde dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it ſelfe in filthy things, or drinkes in filthy objects, when our thoughts are ſteeped in puddle waters, this defiles the minde, and makes our thoughts uncleane; <hi>Our thoughts are ſuch, as the things they are familiar with:</hi> If they converſe with filthy and uncleane things, with wordly and baſe things, the image and impreſſion of ſuch things is ſealed upon our thoughts, and the ſpring of them our ſpirits. On the other ſide, by our converſing and reverend fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with Chriſt; in holy Ordinances, we receive ſtamps and
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:40455:242"/> impreſſions of holineſſe from him. When our hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are raiſed up and pitcht upon God, this makes them holy. <note place="margin">Summa puritas conſiſtit in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haeſione cum Deo; nam Deus eſt ratio objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va &amp; menſura ſanctitatis Leſſ. ubi ante.</note>

                  <p>God is the <hi>Objective cauſe</hi> of holineſſe, looking upon him, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come holy (2 Cor. 3. 18.) <hi>We</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>all with open face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a glaſſe, the glory of the Lord</hi> (that is, we looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that glory, holineſſe and excellencie, which is in the Lord) <hi>are changed into the ſame image:</hi> That is, we are made conformable unto him: we receive (as it were) the engravings of holineſſe upon our ſoules by beholding the <hi>Holy One.</hi> The eye of faith (as well, yea more, then the eye of ſence) affects the hearts. <hi>Labans</hi> ſheepe conceived according to the colour of the rods, which lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in the water troughes. <hi>Viſion aſſimilates both in nature and in grace, yea and in glory too.</hi> In heaven we ſhall be perfectly holy, becauſe we ſhall perfectly (in Chriſt, who is the expreſſe image of his perſon) ſee God, and ſo be like him, that's the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 Joh. 3 1. <hi>We ſhall he like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> And proportionably here, ſuch as our viſions of God are, ſuch is our like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto God. Secondly, obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They who want holineſſe, muſt goe to God for it; for he is the holy One.</hi> Are any of your hearts unholy? Whither will you goe? To what <hi>Coast will you trade for holineſſe?</hi> Or where ſhall you finde the merchandize of it? Goe whither you will, goe to what holy Ordinance, to what holy duty, to what holy Miniſter you will, your veſſels will returne unfraight and emptie of holineſſe, if you tread not to the holy God. We muſt deale with Ordinances and by Ordinances; but, if we onely have to doe with them, neglecting to meet with God, we ſhall make nothing of them, we ſhall not traffick in them to any ſpirituall enriching or advantage. Ordinances have a relative holineſſe or a holineſſe paſſing through them; but they have no inherent holineſſe, or holineſſe paſſed by them; <hi>They are Conduit-pipes, not ſprings, or the well-head.</hi> Therefore as when you would have mercy, you goe to the <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God;</hi> As, when you would have pardon of ſin, you goe to the <hi>ſinne pardoning God;</hi> As when you would have wiſdome and light to direct your way, you goe to the <hi>wiſe God and the Father of lights.</hi> So when you would have holineſſe, and be made pure, whither will ye goe, but to the pure and holy God? Be diligent in holy duties, and holy Ordinances, but ſtay not in them, paſſe through them, and never reſt till you come to God in Chriſt, who is, <hi>The holy One,</hi> and he onely can, and he hath ſaid he will make you holy.</p>

But when theſe wretches ſaw God delaying to come out, and bring forth the treaſures of his wrath againſt them, they fall a jeering, and they jeer at God, under this title <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 5, 19.) <hi>Let him make ſpeed and hasten his work that we may ſee it;</hi> as if they had ſaid, God is too ſlow let him make more haſt, <hi>and let the counſel of the holy One of Iſrael draw nigh, and come that we may know it;</hi> him, that you have ſo often told us of, <hi>The holy One,</hi> let him make haſt and bring on his work.

We doe not ſanctifie God by adding or communicating any holineſs unto him; but we ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God by acknowledging his holineſs, or by acknowledging that he is, <hi>The Holy One; drawing nigh unto God with a holy heart, with holy affections is the ſanctfying of God.</hi> For this is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſuch preparation, I have a holy God to go unto, therefore I muſt have a holy heart to come unto him with; this is ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God; And that's the reaſon why none can ſee God, but they, that are holy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> becauſe God himſelf is holy, therefore they cannot ſee God, who are unholy. There muſt be an inward holineſs, holineſs in the Organ: to take in the holineſs of the object; God firſt works holineſs in us, and then we behold him, <hi>the holy God:</hi> And that was the reaſon, why the Prophet <hi>(Iſa. chap.</hi> 6. when the voice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that thrice holy Name of God, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,)</hi> cried out, <hi>I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips,</hi> I have an unclean heart, and how ſhall I ſtand before this <hi>holy, holy, holy God;</hi> This made his ſpirit recoyl, though he was a holy Prophet: <hi>If the remainders of unholineſſe in him, made his ſpirit faint, when there was an appearance of the holy God: How will they that are nothing but corruption, or a lump of uncleanneſs, lying ſtill in the dregs of nature, be able to ſtand before God, The holy One, the holy, holy, holy One!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the ſumme of the firſt reaſon, upon which <hi>Job</hi> grounds his requeſt to die, it was not the miſery he ſuffered, but the integrity in which he had lived. He had not concealed the words of <hi>the holy One,</hi> therefore as his affliction made his life troubleſome to him, ſo the goodneſs of his cauſe and conſcience, made death welcome to him.</p>

                     <hi>JOB</hi> (as hath been ſhewed) in this context from the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, renewes his former requeſt and deſire of death, confirming it by divers arguments, ſome of which were opened in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, eſpecially, that, from the clearneſs, and integrity of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in that, <hi>he had not concealed the words of the the holy One:</hi> He had dealt faithfully in the cauſe of God, and therefore he was not afraid to appear before God. And his deſire did not hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his lips, as if it would return and deny it ſelf: therefore in this 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe he puts forth two reaſons further, why he moves or re-enforces his motion to die. The firſt is grounded upon the ſmall hope, he had to live long, if he ſhould deſire it, <hi>What is my ſtrength, that I ſhould hope?</hi> The ſecond is grounded upon the ſtrong hope, yea, aſſurance which he had, that it ſhould be well with him in death, or that death, could be no dammage to him. <hi>And what is my end, that I ſhould prolong my life?</hi> Put theſe two together: And then conſider, is it any wonder, that a man in much miſery deſires to die ſpeedily, when he hath no hope, no ground of hope, that he can live long, and when he hath no fear, no ground, no nor ſhaddow of fear, that it ſhall be ill with him, when he dies? This I conceive is the ſum and ſtrength of his reaſoning, contained in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now open the words diſtinctly.</p>
                  <q>What is my ſtrength, that I ſhould hope?</q>
                  <p>Some render it, <hi>What is my ſtrength, that I ſhould bear?</hi> that I ſhould be able to ſuſtain this weighty burthen, this mighty load of affliction, preſſing my wounded ſoul, and wearied body. Thus it refers to his preſent ſufferings, to the enduring and ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:40455:244"/> which, he found his own ſtrength altogether inſufficient. And ſo the <hi>[My]</hi> in the text, <hi>What is [my] ſtrength,</hi> ſeems to be <note place="margin">

Why do you think, I have not done that, all this while? Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that I have ſtood out theſe aſſault in My own ſtrength? What is My ſtrength, that I ſhould bear? That I ſhould bear this burthen ſo long, as I have born it? Surely I have been held up by the power of God and prayer all this while: God hath put his everlaſting armes under me, otherwiſe I had fallen before this day, hid I not prayed in ayd from heaven, I had not lived thus long upon the earth; for what is my ſtrength compared to theſe burthens, which are upon me?</hi>

                  <p>This is a good ſence; For, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes <hi>(Gal</hi> 2. 10.) <hi>The life which I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to ſay, the life which I have lived, ever ſince theſe afflictions have encompaſs'd me, I have lived by the power of God, and the ſtrength of faith in him. <hi>What i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This (I ſay) is a good ſence, but the word rather ſignifies to hope; and yet theſe two are not at any great odds: for hope is the ſtrength, the bearing-ſtrength of the ſoul: <hi>What is my ſtrength, that I ſhould hope?</hi> That I ſhould wait and tarry, that I ſhould expect or ſtay for ſuch and ſuch changes, as thou haſt promiſed? <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 130 5. we have theſe words put together, <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait; and in his word do I hope. The ſoul which is in a hoping condition, is alſo in a waiting condition;</hi> waiting and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ever attend the ſame thing. No man will wait at all for that of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:40455:245"/> which, he hath no hope, and he who hath hope, will wait always He gives not over waiting, till he gives over hoping. The object of hope is ſome future good, but the act of hoping is a preſent good, and that is preſent pay to bear our charges in waiting. So then the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies both a patient writing, and a hopefull truſting. So Chriſt expoundes it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 21. rendring that of the prophet, Iſa. 42. 4. <hi>The iſles ſhall wait for his Law,</hi> thus, <hi>In his name ſhall the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles truſt. Noah</hi> (after the ſtrength of the deluge was ſpent) <note place="margin">Gen 8. 10, 12.</note> opened the window of the Arke, and ſent forth the Dove, and ſhe returned; then ſaith the text, <hi>He waited ſeven daies, and again he waited, yet other ſeven daies,</hi> hoping at laſt the floud would be dried up, and the waters return into their ancient channels. Now (ſaith <hi>Job)</hi> what is my ſtrength, that I ſhould hope or expect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and therefore, why ſhould I wait for it.

                  <p>And in this paſſage he ſeemes to anſwer, what <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeak in the 5th <hi>Chapter,</hi> verſ. 16. and 25.

                  <q>What is mine end, that I ſhould prolong my life, or my deſire of life?</q>
                  <p>His <hi>[End]</hi> may be conſidered two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, His end, may be taken for the latter part of his life, which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> promiſed would be very comfortable, <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy grave in a good old age, as a ſhock of corn commeth into the flore;</hi> As if <hi>Job</hi> ſhould ſay, you are promiſing me good dayes, and a happy old age, but, what is mine end? what's the latter part of a mans life, that he ſhould deſire to prolong his dayes, to take it out? why ſhould I deſire to prolong my life, I am now well ſtricken in years, and as for the end, the latter part of a mans life, it is nothing (for the moſt part) but trouble and ſorrow? As old <hi>Barzillai</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 35.) when <hi>David</hi> offered him the pleaſures of the Court) anſwers, I am thus old, and can I taſte my meat, and taſte my drink, or hear muſique? What is the Fagge-end of mans life, that one ſhould hunger after it? The ſweeteſt comforts of this life are in the fore-part of life, in the ſpring of youth, in the ſtrength and flower of age. As for the winter of life, what is that but wet and cold, but clouds and darkneſs? <hi>What is my end</hi> (of old age) that I ſhould deſire my life to be prolonged or eeked out to that.</p>
                  <p>But rather, we may take this <hi>End;</hi> Firſt, For the end of his troubles; As if he had ſaid, <hi>What end ſo gainfull or comfortable can I have of theſe evils, that ſhould recompence my pains in bearing them, till I receive it?</hi> No worldly comforts can anſwer my ſorrows; and therefore why ſhould I deſire to prolong my life for them?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take <hi>End,</hi> for the very laſt term of life, not that latter part or condition of a mans life, <hi>troubleſome old age,</hi> as before; or a renewed eſtate as here. But take <hi>End,</hi> for the <hi>ending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:40455:246"/> termination, the period of life; <hi>What is my end, that I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long my life?</hi> and ſo, End is as much as death, <hi>what is my death that I ſhould deſire to live?</hi> I know no evil in death, that ſhould make me afraid of the end of my life; I know no ſuch trouble in dying, that I ſhould be deſirous to ſpinne out this troubleſome life longer, ſurely the trouble and pain of death, is not ſo much as the preſent trouble and pain of my life, and as for any other trouble, I fear none: then, What is my end, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould prolong my life, that I ſhould not deſire death, or that you ſhould be ſo angry with me for deſiring it? Hence obſerve, firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no ſtrength in man, that may give him aſſured hope of long life; What is my ſtrength that I ſhould hope?</hi> No, though man be in the flouriſh of his age, the greeneſſe of his years: yet what is youth, or ſtrength, or beauty? what all thoſe fair leaves and fruits, which hang upon and adorn this goodly tree, that he ſhould hope to hand long? <hi>Man in his beſt eſtate, is altogether vanity, Pſal.</hi> 39. 5. He that hopes to live upon any of theſe things, hopes in a vain thing, &amp; truſts, but in a ſhadow. Our hopes to live this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life as well as the ſpiritual, and eternal, muſt be in the living God. The Image of death ſits upon the beſt of our ſtrength and beauty; while we grow, we decline, and while we flouriſh, we wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The lengthening of our dayes, is the ſhortning of them, and all the time we live, is but a paſſage unto (and ſhould be but a preparation for) death. We are moſt miſerable, if in this life only we have hope; and we are moſt fooliſh, if our hopes of this life, be in our own ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe there is no ſtrength in nature, which may give us hope to live long; It is our greateſt wiſdome, to conſider what proviſion we have in grace, to maintain our hopes, that we ſhall live for ever. They are in an ill caſe, who when they cannot hope to live long, care not to ſettle their hopes of living eternally. It is a moſt ſad ſpectacle, to ſee a languiſhing body, and a langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing hope meet in one man. Some have a <hi>Kalender in their bones,</hi> ſhewing them, they have but few dayes here, and many diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers upon the whole body, crying in their ears with a loud voice, <hi>what is your strength, that you ſhould hope to live?</hi> who yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare not at all to die. They are both unready and unwilling to be diſſolved, when they ſee no hope to keep up their tabernacle from deſolution.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, (taking the word in the laſt ſenſe, which I conceive
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:40455:247"/> rather to be the mind of the holy Ghoſt in this place) obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That there is no evil in the death of a godly man, which ſhould make him unwilling to die, or which ſhould make him linger after this life.</hi> What is the end of a godly man, that he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his life? All the bitterneſs of death is removed, or ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Chriſt. Death the King of terrours, is made a ſervant, to let us in, to our comforts, by the power of <hi>Chriſt, that prince of life</hi> who hath aboliſhed death and brought life and immortality to light by the Goſpel. <hi>A believer buries all his feares of death in the grave of Chriſt.</hi> He looks upon death as the funeral of his ſo rows, and the reſurrection of his joyes. When the Pſalmiſt had deſcribed the troubles and ſtormy conflicts of a godly man, together with the flouriſhing outward pompe of the wicked, he concludes with this advice, <hi>Mark the righteous man</hi> (obſerve him well, take ſpecial notice of him) <hi>the latter and of that man is peace;</hi> if his end be peace, there is nothing in his end, which can make him afraid of it, or put it off. All deſire peace, they eſpecially, <note place="margin">Pacem te poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus omnes.</note> who are wearied out with war. The life of the holieſt man is a warfare, and his end is peace. Then what is his end, that he ſhould prolong his life.</p>
                  <p>When a worldly man looks upon his end, he ſaith, O what is my end, that I ſhould deſire to die? His end is ſuch, as makes him juſtly afraid to die. There is nothing in the end of a wicked man, but matter to feed the fear of death, and the deſire of prolonging life, as long as he can. This is the reaſon, why, when God cals him to die, he is deaf at the call; yea, that call is death to him, before he dies. <hi>Lot</hi> had a mind to prolong his time in <hi>Sodom,</hi> it was a goodly City, and he was not well aſſured, whether to goe, or how he ſhould be lodged next night. This cauſed him to linger ſo long, till the Angels came and thruſt him out: Natural men have all their portion and eſtates in the <hi>Sodom</hi> of this world. And if they hear a meſſage of departing or going out, they linger and make excuſes, they run behind the door or hang about the poſts, till God thruſts them out of the world, and puls from them their pleaſures, by head and ſhoulders, as we ſay. They would never leave the world, if they might enioy it, becauſe they have nothing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy beyond it.</p>
                  <p>A worlding groans, becauſe he muſt be uncloathed of his houſe of earth, and the Saints <hi>groan earnestly, that they may be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon with their houſe from heaven;</hi> Who would not be willing
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:40455:247"/> to exchange a ſuit of fleſh, a ſuit of ſackcloth, and ſorrow, for a ſuit of glory, for a cloathing of immortality and garments of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting praiſe.</p>
                  <q>Ver. 12. <hi>Is my ſtrength, the ſtrength of ſtones? Or is my fleſh of braſs?</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Theſe words may refer to the former part of the eleventh verſe, <hi>What is my ſtrength, that I ſhould hope?</hi> What is it?

Only a body of braſs and ſinewes of Iron, are ſtrong enough to endure this tryal. Stones and braſs are hard bodies and heavy bodies, they can bear blows and knocks without breaking; They yield not eaſily to the hammer; It is hard to make an impreſſion upon them, with many, and thoſe violent ſtrokes. To ſay a man is as ſtrong as ſtones, or that, he hath a body of braſſe, is to give him ſtrength, which is not mans, and to ſet him two degrees below himſelf. Beaſts are ſtronger, and can endure more hardſhip then man. Trees are ſtronger, and can endure more than Beaſts. Stones are yet ſtronger, and can endure more then Trees. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, while he asks, whether his ſtrength be not only, like that of beaſts, who have no reaſon, or like that of trees, which have no ſenſe; but like that of ſtones and braſs, which have no vegetation or growth, he puts it to the utmoſt, as if he had ſaid, <hi>If a man had as much ſtrength as a Beaſt, or a Tree, he muſt needs fall at theſe stroaks and troubles, but it ſeems, ye put me lower then ſenſeleſs beaſts or trees, and that I can ſtand it out againſt all ſtorms and batteries, like a ſtony rock, or a brazen wall.</hi> I confeſſe, though the oxe loweth, when he wants fodder, and the wilde Aſſe brayeth, when he hath no graſſe, yet the ſtone complains not, when you give it no food, nor doth braſs cry out, when you melt it in a Furnace: unleſs you can find, that I am in nature, like ſtones or braſs, you have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to find fault with me. Allow me to be either man or beaſt, and you muſt allow me to be ſenſible of my ſorrows, and deſtroyable by them. Only ſtones can be thus trampled on, and braſs thus hammer'd without pain and dying.</p>
                  <p>As when man (in his ſpiritual capacity) is ſaid in Scripture to have a <hi>heart of ſtone, an iron ſinew, a brow of Braſs.</hi> It notes him reſolved, againſt all threats, and ſtrong, againſt all oppoſitions of
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:40455:248"/> the word, to commit the evil of ſin. So in his natural capacity, to ſay his ſtrength is the ſtrength of ſtones, notes him a man able to bear all the evils of trouble, and to ſtand againſt all the ſtormes of tribulation.</p>

                  <q>Verſ. 13, <hi>Is not my help in me? And is wiſdom driven quite from me?</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>This and the verſe following, are of a very difficult conſtruction and underſtanding, which cauſed a learned Interpreter to ſay, <hi>If</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Locus difficilis ſiquis a lius in hoc libro, &amp; quem ego adbuc non intelligo.</hi> Druſ.</note> 
                     <hi>there be any hard text in the whole book, this is one;</hi> and after all his thoughts about it, he concludes with this ingenuous acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I do not yet underſtand the meaning of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, as we read it, The text ſeems to carry a harſh connexion with the words fore-going. There <hi>Job</hi> queries, <hi>Is my ſtrength, the ſtrength of ſtones?</hi> And yet immediately to ſay, <hi>Is not my help in me?</hi> ſounds incongruous. For if he had help in him, he had ſtrength in him, and ſuch as might well be called, the ſtrength of ſtones, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtrength. So then, <hi>Iob</hi> having ſaid with his laſt breath, <hi>that he had no ſuch ſtrength,</hi> how is it, that here he ſhould ſay and more, ſtrongly affirm, that he had ſuch ſtrength, ſo much this queſtion implies, <hi>Is not my help in me?</hi> As if he had ſaid, do not I know which way to help my ſelf? How to extricate my ſelf out of this condition?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, how is this a truth? For there is no man, that hath his help in himſelf, not help enough in himſelf for any natural work, much leſſe for any ſpiritual work, and moſt of all, leſſe for the holy carriage of the heart under affliction, or to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from it. Man hath no help in himſelf. The voice of the Church is, <hi>Our help ſtandeth in the Name of the Lord;</hi> and the voice of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> was, <hi>The Lord is my helper;</hi> how then doth <hi>Iob</hi> ſay, <hi>Is not my help in me?</hi> Mans ruine is in himſelf, but how unlike is this to the voice of truth, to ſay, <hi>My help is in my ſelf?</hi> We can undoe our ſelves faſt enough, but we cannot repair and make our ſelves up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>Nor can any creature be our help, no man, no Angel can be
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:40455:249"/> our help. God reproveth the Jewes, Iſa. 31. <hi>For going down to Egypt for help,</hi> though they were a ſtrong people: <hi>Certainly it is as bad, for a man, to make himſelf his help, as to make another man his help.</hi> How then ſhall we give a wholeſome underſtanding of theſe words, <hi>Is not my help in me? And is wiſdome driven quite from me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the clearing of it conſider the divers readings. Some thus, <hi>Was not my help in me?</hi> And ſo they make the meaning to <note place="margin">

Did not I put my ſelf forth to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that I could, to ſtand under theſe troubles and afflictions? There is much in that, for ſome men do not help themſelves, as they might, but their own ſpirits ſinke, and their hearts fail, yea, their hearts fail before their ſtrength failes. <hi>Job</hi> diſclaims this, I did not ſo, I helpt my ſelf while I was able, I put out the utmoſt of my power, to bear and ſet a good face on't, as long as ever I could, <hi>Was not my help in me?</hi>

                     <pb n="485" facs="tcp:40455:249"/> 
                     <hi>not the ſtrength of ſtones; there is no help in me, and they who ſhould help me, are departed from me;</hi> I was once an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame <hi>(Chap.</hi> 29. 15.) <hi>When a man hath no help in himſelf, he may have it in another;</hi> If a man want an eye, he may have an eye of his neighbour, and if he want a hand, his friend may be a hand to him; but (ſaith <hi>Job)</hi> they that ſhould be <hi>eyes and hands,</hi> helpers unto me, are gone and departed from me.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another rendering, which makes a very clear ſence; <hi>What though I have no help in me, is wiſdome driven quite from me?</hi> Though I have no ſtrength, and ſo no help in my ſelf, wiſdom is not therefore driven quite from me. As if he had ſaid, <hi>will you conclude that I am a wicked man, an hypocrite and a fool, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not able to help and deliver my ſelf out of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?</hi>

<pb n="487" facs="tcp:40455:250"/> Oak, his ſubſtance ſhall be in him, the ſeed of Holineſſe ſhall be his ſubſtance. <hi>Is not my helpe in me?</hi> I know my eſtate is gone, my beauty is gone, my ſtrength is gone, the ſtrength (I mean) of my fleſh, yet I have inviſible ſupports, ſomewhat unſeen to truſt unto. It is the comfort of beleevers, that they have an eſtate, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and poſſeſſions, lying as far beyond the reach of mens pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as their eye; and as far beyond the reach of Satans malice, as either. When they feel nothing but pain in the fleſh, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but weakneſs inhabits the <hi>houſe of clay,</hi> the outward man, then the <hi>inward man</hi> is renewed with ſweet refreſhings, and ſtrong conſolations <hi>day by day. The ſpirit of a man</hi> (of a godly man) <hi>will bear his infirmities, when his body cannot.</hi> The ſtrength of nature <hi>is not as the strength of ſtones, nor is the fleſh of braſs,</hi> but the ſtrength of grace, is ſtronger then the ſtrength of ſtones, and the ſpirit is more dureable then braſſe: Grace wears not out by uſing, nor doth it ſpend by employing: <hi>Afflictions are but the higher ſervices and employments of grace:</hi> A ſtock of grace, is an inexhauſtible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a good heart, aſſures us better then the barrs of a Caſtle. Faith and a good conſcience, are (under Chriſt) our beſt helpes in trouble; they are friends that will never forſake us: They are to us as their Authour, who, hath promiſed that he, will not. Grace is our participation with the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and grace participates with the divine nature in this, it is an unchangeable good, an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting comfort.</p>
                  <p>And yet we muſt take this warily, grace and holineſs, faith and a good conſcience, are not to be truſted upon, no more then riches or any outward meanes. <hi>We may make an Idol of our faith, and a vaine thing of a good conſcience:</hi> The meaning then is, faith and a good conſcience are our beſt helds and friends, becauſe faith car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us unto Chriſt who is our beſt help. Faith pitches upon Chriſt and a good conſcience, feaſts us in the favour of God. Faith alone is no help, but faith is our help, becauſe it is not alone: Grace left alone would be our ſtrength but little more then nature is, and our ſpirit little more then the fleſh. And therefore our comforts are not to be reſolved into this, That we have grace in our hearts, but into this, That we and our graces are in the hand of Chriſt. Faith can live no where but upon Chriſt; That which faith reſpects as our help, is Chriſt in whom we beleeve, not the act of beleeving, We are helped by the grace within us, but the grace within us, is not our help.

                     <hi>A godly man in the darkeſt affliction or night of ſorrow, finds a light of holy wiſdome to anſwer all the objections of his enemies, and the ſuſpitions of his friends; Is wiſdome departed quite from me?</hi> Doe you think I have nothing to ſay? nothing to reply by way of apologie for what I have don or ſpoken?</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Job</hi> had many afflictions upon him and his friends againſt him, yet ſee how he recollects himſelfe, <hi>Is not my help in me?</hi> he makes out the goodneſſe of his cauſe, in the midſt of a thouſand evils, and can plead his own integrity, in the throng of many jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and contradictions. <hi>Is not my help in me?</hi> Doe you think, you have ſo daunted me, that I am not able to make out my own eſtate? or that I know not what I am? The truth is, ſometimes God leaves his ſervants in ſo much darkneſs, for their tryal and exerciſe, that they cannot ſee their own eſtates, but cry out, they are loſt and undone; Many a good ſoul cannot reflect upon his graces, or get his heart into any communion with Chriſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. <hi>This is walking in darkneſs, and ſeeing no light. As our ſins are ſometimes ſecrets to us, ſo alſo our graces may.</hi> But let a man be encompaſt with never ſo many outward afflictions, yet if his ſpirit be free, he is able to judge of his own intereſts, through all the black clouds which hang over him, through all the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and confuſions that are about him. <hi>The eye of faith is uſually quickeſt, in a dark night. And while trouble is near at hand, beholds Christ, near at hand. He can never be without help, who carries his help about him, or within him.</hi> Nor can he utterly want counſel to direct him, whoſe heart is as a councel Table, where Chriſt (the wiſdom of God) is ever Preſident and in the Chair. My worldly comforts are quite driven from me, but wiſdome is not: I am afflicted, and therefore ſhould not be thus ſuſpected, but pittied.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Further, The word, as we tranſlate, imports more than a bare act of pitty or commiſeration; as ſuppoſe a man ſee his brother in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, compaſſionates him, but relieves him not, this is not pity. Such the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> deſcribes, in his firſt Chapter, verſ. 15. <hi>If a brother or a ſiſter be naked, and deſtitute of daily food, and you ſay unto them, be filled, be warmed, be cloathed;</hi> poor creatures, ye are hungry, yea are naked, I pitty you, I am ſorry to ſee you thus; be filled, be cloathed; I wiſh it were otherwiſe with you; and yet in the mean time he gives them nothing wherewith either to cloath or feed them; Is this fulfilling the law of love? Is this charity? Nothing leſſe. The pity here ſpoken of, is not a verbal piety; Our ſaying to a brother in trouble, be comforted, or I would, courſe were taken for you, I wiſh you well with all my heart, and ſo we beſtow a mouth-ful of good words, but not ſo much as a morſell of bread, or a cup of cold water. Good words alone are cheap charity to mans expence, and they are ſo cheap in Gods eſteem, that they will not be found of any value at all in the day of recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: good words, not realized, if they be found any where, will be found in the treaſures of wrath. This is not the <hi>pitty which (Job</hi> teacheth us) <hi>ſhould be ſhewed to him that is afflicted:</hi> The Apoſtles queſion ſhakes ſuch out of all claime to this grace, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>whoſoever</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath this worlds goods, and ſeeth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how doth the love of God dwell in him?</hi> Though a mans mouth be open with good words, yet if he ſhut his bowels from good deeds, there is no love to God or man hous'd in that mans heart. <hi>It is</hi>

                     <hi>no Pitty (to ſpeak of) onely to ſpeak pitty;</hi> and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle addes, <hi>verſe</hi> 18 <hi>My little children, let us not love in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth;</hi> thats the true meaning of this word, <hi>to him that is afflicted, pitty ſhould be ſhewed;</hi> But you (my friends) have not given me ſo much as the ſound of pitty, you have not bemoaned me, much leſs have you relieved me, which is the ſubſtance of pitty, reall pitty: You have not loved me in tongue, giving me good words, much leſs in deed and in truth. Deed-pitty, is both the duty and the diſpoſition of a godly man: therefore this word <hi>(Chaſid)</hi> in the concrete, is often uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſignify a godly man: He is one that hath obtained much grace and pitty from the Lord, and he is kind, gracious and pittiful unto men.

<pb n="494" facs="tcp:40455:254"/> with afflictions, hath forſaken him; but hath the fear of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty forſaken him alſo?</p>
                  <p>The meaning whereof may be made out to this effect. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid thus. You plainly ſee, that there is no help in me, for my pains and unceſſant troubles, have quite bereaved me of all that ſtrength, upon which I ſhould naturally ſubſiſt; And as for you (my friends) that pitty and compaſſion, which you ſhould afford a man thus melted with ſorrows, is quite fled and gone from your hearts and lips. But what then? Is the fear of God departed alſo from this ſorrowful ſoul? It is confeſſed, ſtrength is gone from my body, and I ſee pitty towards me, is gone from your ſoules. O, how miſerable then were I, if I ſhould goe from my God, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his fear! You ſhall ſee, that though the pitty of men hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, a melted man, yet (as you object) the fear of God hath not.</p>
                  <p>A ſeventh reading, varying from ours only in a word, gives the ſence very fair and eaſie * <hi>to him that is afflicted or melted, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be ſhewed by his friend, otherwiſe he forſakes the fear of the Almighty.</hi> Whereas we ſay, <hi>[but he forſaketh]</hi> this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſaith <hi>[Otherwiſe he forſaketh] the fear of the Almighty,</hi> that is, if a man do not ſhew pitty to his friend in affliction, that man ſheweth that he hath forſaken the fear of the Almighty. Thus as I hinted at the entrance of this paſſage, Interpreters are much divided about the Grammatical conſtruction of theſe words; There is a truth in every ſence given, and their variety may teach us to adore the fulneſs of the holy language, which leads our thoughts ſo many wayes, as alſo to be humbled for our own blindneſs of mind, and narrowneſs of heart, to ſee or comprehend the mind of God fairly written to us.</p>
                  <p>But I take the laſt to be the cleareſt meaning of <hi>Job</hi> in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and that, to which moſt of the former are reducible, and therefore ſtaying upon this ſence, I ſhall give two or three obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is the common duty of friends, and the ſpeciall duty of godly friends, to pitty and help one another in affliction.</hi> I ſay, to pitty and to help (for that is the compaſſe of the word) we have not done our duty in pittying the diſtreſſed, unleſs we come to real aſſiſting them. We ſatisfie not our obligation to the bond and Law of love by giving comfortable words. As that faith, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without works, doth not juſtifie us, ſo that pitty which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:40455:254"/> without works, doth not juſtifie our faith; ſuch empty pitty will goe for little better then cruelty, and not to help, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted oppreſſion. <hi>Word-pitty is but the leafe of love, Deed-pity is the fruit of it.</hi> As we ſhould <hi>labour to be filled with all the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Chriſt,</hi> ſo with all the fruits of love, of compaſſion, and of tenderneſs, for theſe alſo are by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, unto the glory and praiſe of God,</hi> Phil. 1. 11. Obſerve ſecondly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the fear of God is ever joyned with love to our brethren.</hi> True religion (that we mean by fear) hath a double bond in it, a bond of obedience to God, and a bond of love to men. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle puts ſo much of religion in the latter, that in one place he makes it, all religion, the very definition of religion, <hi>Jam</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Pure religion and undefiled before God</hi> (what is it?) <hi>It is this, to viſit the fatherleſs and the widows in their affliction.</hi> This is religion and pure religion, that is, this is a great branch of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ſpecial fruit, which ſprings from that goodly tree, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To viſit the fatherleſs, is more then to lock upon them, and ask them, how they doe: To viſit them is to help them: It is like that viſit (in it's proportion) which Chriſt made into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed world. He viſited and redeemed his people, or he viſited his people, to redeem them. And, the fatherleſſe, to whoſe viſit religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lead us, are not only poor children or Orphans, whoſe parents are lately dead, and they not able to ſhift for themſelves, but the fatherleſſe are all the afflicted, who want our help, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. Every helpleſs and comfortleſs ſoul is as an Orphan without parents, as a widow without a husband, <hi>To relieve ſuch is pure religion.</hi> In the 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4. 20. the Apoſtle makes that an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting conviction againſt any man, that he loves not God, if he loves not his brother; <hi>If a man ſay he loveth God, and hateth his brother,</hi> (there is no <hi>medium</hi> in this point, between hating and not loving, or between hating and not helping, it it be in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) <hi>he is a lyar, for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God, whom he hath not ſeen? Job</hi> puts it ſo here, you ſhould ſhew pitty to your friend in affliction, but you forſake the fear of the Almighty, and where fear of God is not, the love of God is not. <hi>Love to God is viſible in love to man.</hi> And in affliction, the love of man to man, is made moſt viſible. <hi>A true friend can hardly be diſcovered in proſperity, and a falſe friend can hardly be hid in adverſity.</hi> Laſtly, obſerve,</p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:40455:255"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>It is not enough, not to be cruel to, or not to grieve the afflicted.</hi> We muſt ſhew them favour and doe them good. The light of nature condemns the oppreſſour, and the light of religion condemns them who ſhew no pity.</p>

                  <p>JOB having in the former verſe begun to charge his friends with unkindneſſe, proceeds in this Context to illuſtrate his charge by a ſimilitude; To make their unkindneſs, yet more notorious and viſible, he ſets it out by things, which are viſible: that ſo their own eyes or experiences might convince them, as well as his Diſcourſe. The whole ſimilitude is extended from the 15th to the 21th verſe. The ſum of all is this, That <hi>Job</hi> had found his friends like thoſe brooks, which hold leaſt water, when there is moſt need, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enquiry for water; they gave him no comfort, when he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (to the eye) but ſorrow.

This may ſeem to be a fabulous report, but the reaſon given (which is direct to the point in hand) makes it not onely probable, but very plain; For they tell us, that this river is not feed by a fountain or a ſpring, but is cauſed merely by the melting of the ſnow, which lies on the mountains thereabouts: in the day time, when the ſun is up and warme, the ſnow melts, but when night comes, and the Sun goes down, the ſnow freezes, and ſo the channel dries. Thus it is with thoſe, who have not an inward principle of holineſſe, they may have a great floud of profeſſion, when the ſnow melts down into their boſomes, by the ſhine of outward proſperity; but when night, and cold, when troubles &amp; dangers come, their waters freeze up, or paſſe away, and goe to nothing. So much of the cauſes, why theſe ſtreams, theſe water brooks vaniſh, they have no ſpring to maintain and feed them: Raine, and froſt, and ſnow (uncertain all) are all they have to truſt to.</p>

                     </note> That is, when they ſaw there was no water to be had, they would have hid themſelves in the earth, or digged holes, to hide themſelves in, for grief and ſhame.</p>
                  <p>And ſome render this word here (though to another ſence,) <hi>They digged.</hi> That is, when they ſaw that there was no water in the ſtreames, then they fell a digging to ſee; if they could finde any ſprings. Thats a good ſenſe. But rather take digging as before. To ſhew what ſhame would have us do, when we have
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:40455:262"/> done amiſſe, or when we Miſſe what we would find, then we ſeek covert and hide our ſelves. Hence theſe two are often joyned in Scripture, <hi>Shame and hiding, with the diſappointment of hope.</hi> Reade a text of near compliance with this in the letter (Jer. 14. 3.) <hi>Their Nobles have ſent their little ones to the waters, they came to the pits and found no water</hi> (it was in a time of drought) <hi>they returned with their veſſels empty;</hi> What followeth? <hi>they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed and confounded and covered their heads.</hi> Again, verſe. 4. <hi>Becauſe the ground is chapt, for there was no raine in the earth, the plow-men were aſhamed, they covered their heads.</hi> And Joel. 1. 10. 11. <hi>The corn is wasted, the new wine is dried up;</hi> What followeth? <hi>Be aſhamed O ye husband-men; howle O ye Vinedreſſers, becauſe the harveſt of the field is periſhed.</hi> So that in the common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and current of the Scripture, ſhame is an effect of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hiding the face, or covering the head an effect of both. Obſerve hence,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That deceived hopes trouble us as much, if not more than preſent wants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A preſent want is a preſent ſmart; but deceived hopes are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſmart; And that's the reaſon why the burthen of ſorrow is ſo heavy, and the drought of the damned (who, as <hi>Dives</hi> in the Parable, ſhall never have a drop of water) ſo intollerable. They (to allude to the text) hoped to come to the over flowing ſtreams of their former earthly delights; But alas, the <hi>paths of the way of thoſe brooks are turned aſide for ever, they are gone to nothing and periſhed.</hi> All the while they travel (and that will be an eternity) through that howling wilderneſſe and fiery deſert, they ſhall not meet with one rivolet, nor taſt one drop of comfort to cool their parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tongues, or refreſh their inflamed bowels. <hi>Hopes delayed trouble, but hopes deceived, confound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve from this paſſage,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That deceived hopes fill with ſhame. Deceived hopes make a man hide his head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shame ariſes two wayes, either from doing a thing againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles. Or from looſing a thing againſt common expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Lord threatens the idolatrous Iſraelites, <hi>That they ſhall be aſhamed of the Oaks, which they have deſired and confounded for the gardens which they had choſen, Iſa.</hi> 1. 29. Why aſhamed of Oakes and gardens? becauſe in gardens, and under ſhadie Oaks, they ſet up and worſhipped Idols, in which they truſted for deliverance and
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:40455:263"/> protection; therefore when deſtruction ſhould over take them, they muſt needs be aſhamed of Oakes and gardens, becauſe their hopes were ſo fowlly deceived by them. In the ſame ſence the Lord ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels them by the ſame Prophet, that they <hi>ſhall be aſhamed of Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, their expectation, and of Egypt their glory,</hi> Chap. 20. 5. becauſe they had hoped for ſo much help, from confederacies with theſe Nations, who in the iſſue would delude their hopes, and give them no help at all. Thus alſo he ſpeaks hiſtorically, Chap. 30, 5. <hi>They were all aſhamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be a help.</hi> All they who hope in any thing, ſave the Lord, ſhall (as theſe troops of <hi>Tema)</hi> be aſhamed, becauſe they have hoped, for they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of their hopes.</p>
                  <p>And this is the reaſon, why hypocrites at the laſt day, when Chriſt comes to judge them, ſhall be filled with ſhame. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (I ſay) is, becauſe they have been ſo full of deluding hopes. It appears they had great hopes, becauſe they ſpeak great words, and make great boaſts. They preſume if any are to be ſaved, they are the men; They ſhew fair for heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Many ſhall ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord have we not prophecyed in thy Name? And in thy Name cast out devils,</hi> &amp;c. They ſhall ſay, Lord we have done thus and thus; what doth this repetition of their great works intimate, but the greatneſſe of their hopes? Now when Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>I know you not,</hi> How will ſhame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their faces for ever; And how will they cover their faces for ſhame, wiſhing they might never be either ſeen or known. When <hi>Jacob</hi> had ſerved a full apprentiſhip in order to his marriage with beautiful <hi>Rachel,</hi> and at laſt, through the guile of <hi>Laban</hi> was put off with <hi>blear-eyed Leah;</hi> the holy Ghoſt expreſſeth him in a kind of paſſionate amazement, <hi>And it came to paſſe, that in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, behold it was Leah. And he ſaid unto Laban, what is this thou haſt done unto me?</hi> As if <hi>Jacob</hi> had been in ſuch a diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he could not tell how to expreſſe himſelf: And therefore ſaith, <hi>What is this thou hast done unto me?</hi> I know not by what name to call ſuch a uſage or diſappointment as this. O, in what a caſe will they be at the laſt day, who have ſerved out (as it were) an apprentiſhip in hopes of <hi>Rachel,</hi> the beauty of heaven and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: And yet when they awake at the reſurrection, <hi>Behold it will be (infinitely worſe than Leah)</hi> Hell and Damnation; How will ſhame and confuſion of face, take hold of ſuch for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?</p>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:40455:263"/>
                  <p> So much for the Letter of this ſimilitude; The failing of thoſe ſtreames, exemplified in the ſad experiences of the troops of <hi>Tema</hi> and the companies of <hi>Sheba,</hi> as often deceived and aſhamed, as they came to them for water.</p>
                  <p>Now follows the application of the ſimilitude; as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>I have ſpoken in the clouds, and told you ſtories of forraign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. I tell you friends, I muſt even apply all this to you, and leave it at your doors.</hi> As <hi>Nathan,</hi> when he had told <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Parable</hi> of the poor man and his little ew-lamb, which his rich neighbor took away to dreſs for the way-ſaringman, that was come unto him; He (I ſay) brings it home to <hi>David</hi> in the cloſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> So after <hi>Job</hi> had told a ſtory in the general or in a third perſon, about deceitfull brooks, and travellers decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them, now he applies it to his friends, Ye my friends are the men I mean by theſe brooks.

What we ſay in our Engliſh proverbe, is true, both of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and of actions, <hi>As good never a white, as never the better; as good not to be, as doe no good.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Judge</hi> ſpeaking of unprofitable perſons (ver. 12,) cals them <hi>Trees without fruit;</hi> And what then? <hi>Twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</hi> As if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſaid, I look upon fruitleſſe perſons, as dead perſons, yea as doubly dead, that is, <hi>dead ſure enough.</hi> As a man can be borne but once, in one kind <hi>(Nicodemus</hi> argued from a truth, though not to a truth, becauſe he could not deſtinguiſh naturall from <hi>Spiritual, John.</hi> 3, 4.) So a man can die but once, in one kind. Theſe men of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, were alive naturally, though dead ſpiritually, how then is it ſaid, that they were twice dead? They were judged <hi>twice-dead,</hi> either, becauſe a ſpiritual death is ſo great a death, that it may well goe for two, yea one ſpiritual death, is worſe then a thouſand natutal deaths</p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, they are ſaid to be <hi>twice-dead,</hi> becauſe they were dead, both in regard of the truth of grace, and in regard of any outward actings of grace; For ſome hypocrites, who are indeed dead in ſinne, yet act grace in many outward fruits, as if they were alive. But of theſe perſons it is ſaid, <hi>their fruit withereth,</hi> and they are <hi>without fruit.</hi> They were not ſo much as externally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; they had no life of union with Chriſt, and they did no good, with the life of their profeſſion in Chriſt, and therefore are juſtly ſaid to be <hi>twice-dead.</hi> They who have leaves and look freſh and lively, as if they hade more then one life in them, yet, if <hi>

Becauſe he was unanſwerable to thoſe purpoſes, to thoſe
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:40455:265"/> ends for which he received life. He was a prodigal, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted his fathers ſervice, therefore his father looked upon him, as if (all that while) he had not been, at all. That's the deſcription of the dead, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi> (when he concluded him torne by a wilde beaſt) <hi>Joſeph is not; and Rachel would not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted for her children, becauſe they were not;</hi> ſo ſaith the Father of the Prodigal, <hi>This my ſon was dead, or he was not;</hi> he was no help nor comfort to me. We no longer deſerve the name or reputation of <hi>Any thing,</hi> then we do thoſe things for which we are. If we leave our duty (upon the matter) we looſe our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are as if we had no being, while we reach not (at leaſt while we reach not after) the end of our being. A Heathen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes of ſuch a man, <hi>He hath onely been, he hath not lived.</hi> But <note place="margin">Fuit, non vixit.</note> we may from the warrant of <hi>Jobes</hi> Rhetorick, go a degree further, and deny that he hath been, <hi>For he is, as if he had never bin, a meer nothing.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Courage in a day of trouble, either of our own or others, is a great cure of trouble, yea a victory over it. There is one fear very good, when we ſee the caſting down of our friends; <hi>To be afraid of provoking God, to caſt us down (Deut.</hi> 17. 13.) <hi>they ſhall hear and fear, and do no more preſumtuouſly;</hi> What ſhall they hear? They ſhall hear how God hath caſt men down, or caſt down a Nation by his judgements, they ſhall hear of this and fear. How ſhall they fear? they ſhall fear to doe preſumtuouſly, fear to provoke that God, who can thus caſt down men and Kingdoms: <hi>It is good to be thus afraid,</hi> but there is a ſinful fear, when fear diſorders or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits us to put our hands to the help of thoſe, who are caſt down, and to adminiſter comfort to thoſe, who are in ſorrow; ſuch was the caſting down, and the fear here meant; They were ſo afraid that they could not lend <hi>Job</hi> a hand, or give him adviſed counſel to ſupport his ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall adde one Obſervation from the general ſcope of the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</p>

                     <hi>need of him.</hi> That is the ſumme of all. In winter, when there is water in every ditch, thoſe brooks abound with water, but in the ſummer, eſpecially in a dry ſummer, when the <hi>rain of the land is duſt</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks,) theſe brooks are duſt too, they vaniſh and are conſumed out of their place, they afford no refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all. When the man, that went down from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> and fell among theeves <hi>(Luke.</hi> 10 30.) lay in the way, ſtript and wounded, even half dead, <hi>A certain Prieſt came that way</hi> (ſaith the text,) <hi>and when he ſaw him, he paſſed by on the other ſide; and likewiſe a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and paſſed by on the other ſide; but the Samaritan went to him</hi> (not from him) <hi>and had compaſſion on him. Job</hi> ſpeaks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neer this language, but fully this ſence, of his friend. They, like the uncharitable Prieſt and Levite, <hi>paſſed by him,</hi> as the <hi>ſtreams of brooks, they paſs away.</hi> Whereas they ſhould have been like the <hi>good Samaritan,</hi> a fountain, a river of ſettled ſpringing comfort to him.</p>
                  <p>This is the great difference between the love of God, and that of moſt men, God is the beſt friend to us at all times (he is beſt to us in the beſt times, if we had not him to friend, it would be very ill with us when we have moſt friends) But God is beſt of all to us in the worſt times; a beſt friend to us when we have no friends: he is our ſpring, when the rain falls, but he is our ſureſt, ſweeteſt ſpring, when there is neither rain nor dew upon the face of the earth. Therefore he is compared (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. ſo in other places) unto a living fountain, where you may be ſure to find water in the hotteſt ſeaſon. This infinitely commends the love of God, beyond that of men, who at the beſt, are but broken ciſterns, which leak out the comforts they are truſted with, and for the moſt part, are but like <hi>Jobs</hi> brookes, they turn aſide and paſſe away, when we have moſt need of them.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerved of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that when ever the <hi>Jews</hi> affairs proſper'd, they would be their friends, and profeſſe much kindneſſe, but if the <hi>Jews</hi> were in trouble, and wanted their aſſiſtance, then they got them far enough off, they would not have to do with them, or own them. <hi>The rich man hath many friends</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 14. 20.) <hi>but the poor is hated even of his own neighbour.</hi>

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:40455:266"/> and from the law of friendſhip. <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 17. 17.) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a true friend, to be one who <hi>loveth at all times, and a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is born for adverſity.</hi> As if he had ſaid, this is the reaſon God hath raiſed up relations, and made men neer one to another, becauſe himſelf orders there ſhall be times of adverſity, when they ſhall have need of one another; Some render the place, <hi>A brother is born in adverſity,</hi> as if the meaning were, That, when a man is in trouble, God raiſes up a brother to help him, Or as the Septuagint hath it, <hi>A brother is born, for this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to help in adverſity.</hi> Therefore a brother loſes the very end and purpoſe why he was born, if he refuſe to help thoſe, who are in adverſity. <hi>Ruth</hi> was a true pattern of a faithful friend and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though a daughter; <hi>I went out full</hi> (ſaith her mother in law) <hi>but the Lord hath brought me home empty;</hi> But though ſhe was emptied of the world, yet <hi>Ruths</hi> heart was full of loue to her, <hi>I will not leave thee; God do ſo to me, and more alſo, if ought but death part thee and me.</hi> So ſaith faithfulneſs in friends, eſpecially in Chriſtian friends; It is one of the greateſt duties and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Chriſtian profeſſion, to ſtick to, and ſtand by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; be it fowl weather, or be it fair, blow the winds high or low, let it be ſtormy or calme, ever to be the ſame.

                  <p>Again, He ſpeakes this to wipe off that aſperſion, as if the loſſe of his eſtate were the thing which grieved and pinched him ſo ſore. <hi>Did I ſay unto you, bring me a reward,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is an argument that a man overloves that, which he hath loſt, when he is over-importunate to have his loſſes repaired.</hi> If you had ſeen me call out unto you for an eſtate, then you had reaſon to think that the loſſe of my eſtate, was the loſſe of my patience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve the temper of a gracious heart under loſſes and afflictions. <hi>A gracious heart under loſſes, is not forward to complain to creatures, or to ask help of men.

                  <p>It is not unlawful for thoſe, that are in want, to make their loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and wants known to men; It is a duty, rather, ſo to doe; onely it muſt be done with caution, leaſt, when we ask of creatures too importunately, we give an argument againſt our ſelves, that we are too much in love with creatures.</p>
                  <p>As it is reproved in thoſe Rulers before ſpoken of, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 18. that <hi>they did love, give ye;</hi> It is a crime in the rich, to love, <hi>give ye;</hi> And certainly it is a ſin, at leaſt an infirmity in thoſe that are poor and in want, to love, <hi>give ye,</hi> or to ſay as <hi>Iob</hi> here had not, <hi>bring to me. Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of the daughters of the <hi>horſleach,</hi> that, they are alwayes crying, <hi>give, give,</hi> noting their inſatiable thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blood.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is the duty of thoſe that are full, to give to their empty bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is their ſin if they give not; and it is their ſhame, if they are not moſt free in giving to thoſe, who are moſt modeſt in asking; But when God hath emptied us, we ſhould not be eager in filling our ſelves. When God takes creatures from us, we ſhould
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:40455:268"/> take heed of purſuing them: we ſhould not doe any thing, which may argue our hearts glued to them, when the Lord hath looſen'd them out of our hands. It is an honour to a poor Chriſtian, when in his greateſt ſtraights he can approve himſelf to God and men, and can ſay as the Apoſtle <hi>(Acts</hi> 20. 33.) <hi>I have coveted no mans ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or gold, or apparel.

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:40455:269"/> upon me, and ſee if I doe not receive and drink them in. And from this word, all doctrine and inſtruction, in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, is called, <hi>Torah, Prov.</hi> 13. 1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 1. And the Jewes, by way of eminency, call the <hi>five books of Moſes</hi> (as alſo all the books of the old Teſtament) the <hi>Torah,</hi> that is, the Law, or rule of holy doctrine, which God rained down from Heaven, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled graciouſly upon his people, for their growth in knowledge and in holineſs: And ſo a <hi>Teacher,</hi> from the ſame root, is called <hi>Moreh; Job.</hi> 36. 22 <hi>Who teacheth like Him?</hi> who raineth like him? <hi>there is no man can diſtill truths, as God doth. Moſes (Deut.</hi> 32. 2.) elegantly ſets forth his preaching, by an allegory of rain and dew. <hi>My doctrine ſhall drop as the rain,; my ſpeech ſhall diſtil as the dew, as the ſmall rain upon the tender herb, and as the ſhowres upon the graſſe.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 6, 7, 8. compares a taught people, to ground that is well watered with rain; <hi>For the earth which drinketh in the rain, that cometh oft upon it, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth fruit, is bleſſed; but that which beareth thorns and briers, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> A people well inſtructed, are like that ground which is under continual ſhowers and dews.</p>
                  <p>And doctrine is fitly compared to rain, and teaching to raining; Firſt becauſe all true &amp; holy doctrine comes from God, as the rain doth. The rain is Gods proper gift, <hi>(Jer.</hi> 14. 22.) <hi>Can any of the vanities of the Gentiles give rain?</hi> All the men in the world, are not able to make one drop of rain; So we may ſay of this figurative rain of truth and holy doctrine, <hi>Can any of the vanities of the Gentiles?</hi> yea, can any of the moſt learned among the ſons of men, give this rain? Can any man make any one truth, which hath not firſt been made above? Truth like rain comes from Heaven, it drops from beyond the clouds. <hi>Art not thou He? O Lord our God? therefore we will wait upon Thee,</hi> ſay they of the natural rain, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 22. and ſo we muſt in regard of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. Hence the word which <hi>Moſes</hi> uſes <hi>(Deut.</hi> 32. 2) for <note place="margin">

                     </note> doctrine, dropping as the rain, ſignifies <hi>a received learning:</hi> Holy Truths are ſo called in that language, becauſe the doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is received from God, not deviſed by men. So the Apoſtle phraſes it (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23.) <hi>I received of the Lord, that which I delivered unto you.</hi> And Chriſt himſelf, <hi>As my Father hath taught me, ſo I ſpeak theſe things, John.</hi> 8. 28. That which <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> ſaid of Chriſt, is true of every one that teacheth truth,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:40455:269"/> 
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Thou art a Teacher come from God.</hi> As truth it ſelf, ſo the teachers of it are from God; as a lye, and the tellers of it, are from the Devil, <hi>John.</hi> 1. 44.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Like rain (as in regard of the original whence it comes, ſo) in regard of the effect: rain refreſheth the earth; when the earth is weary and faint, when the earth gaſpes and is parched, how doth a ſhowre of rain revive it? When the Pſalmiſt had ſpoken of the rain coming down upon the earth, he preſently adds this effect, <hi>The little hills rejoyce on every ſide, they ſhout for joy, they alſo ſing.</hi> Thus alſo a people wearied, and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fainting in ignorance, when they receive truths, and holy inſtructions, how do their hearts rejoyce, how do they <hi>laugh and ſing?</hi> In the Parable, <hi>Mat</hi> 13. Some are ſaid to <hi>receive the word with joy;</hi> Even they who are but formaliſts and hypocrites (for it is ſpoken of them) rejoyce and are refreſhed for a ſeaſon with the word. Truth is ſuch a gracious ſhowre, that they ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with joy, who have no grace. And if truth refreſh men, who are but nature, or move in ſpiritual workes, but, upon natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles, how will it refreſh thoſe, who have grace, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual principles ſutable to it. <hi>Thou, O God</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 68. 9 10.) <hi>didſt ſend a plentiful rain, whereby thou didſt refreſh thine inheritance when it was weary.</hi> That is a truth in the letter, and ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of natural rain; but others interpret that plentiful rain, in a figure, for the rain of doctrine which God ſent down upon his people, when he gave the Law and dropt thoſe heavenly Oracles from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> upon his people <hi>Iſrael:</hi> that ſhowre of the Law came indeed in a ſtorm, Thunder and lightning, and a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempeſt accompanied it. But though the thunder terrified, yet the ſhowre refreſhed; and the Saints have ever delighted in the matter of thoſe inſtructions and holy counſels given there, though <hi>Moſes a chief amongſt the Saints,</hi> ſeared and quaked exceedingly at the manner of giving them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as rain, ſo teaching makes fruitful. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes out this part of the ſimilitude expreſſly, Chap. 55. 10, 11. <hi>As the rain cometh down, and the ſnow from heaven, and returns not thither, but waters the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give ſeed to the ſower, and bread to the eater: So ſhall my word be that goeth out of my mouth,</hi> &amp;c. Hence alſo the people of God are compared <hi>(Deut.</hi> 32. 2.) to graſſe and tender herbs, which grow and flouriſh, which are fed
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:40455:270"/> and bring forth fruit, when watered with the rain. It cannot be denied, though it be much to be lamented, that many ſouls upon whom much of this rain falls, are altogether barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful. But, Oh! How barren are thoſe ſouls, upon whom not a droop of this rain ever fell! They that are deprived of theſe ſhowres are under a grievous curſe, even ſuch a curſe, as <hi>David</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precates upon the mountains of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you,</hi> &amp;c. When God ſaith unto a people, let there be no dew, no raine upon you, no <hi>Moſes</hi> to drop doctrine upon you, no <hi>Paul</hi> to plant, no <hi>Appollo's</hi> to water you with the word, this is the ſaddeſt ſhowre of curſes that can fall upon a people; as without rain, ſo without the word, ordinarily, there can be no fruitfulneſſe. You ſee at this time how upon a little with-holding of the natural raine, we preſently fear barrenneſſe, and famine; the want of ſpiritual rain brings in a <note place="margin">This was preacht in a time of drought.</note> worſe barrenneſſe, though there are not many who fear it, or are ſenſible of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the word taught is like rain in regard of the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it. The rain comes not down alike, at all times; ſhowres are very various; ſometimes it raines ſoftly, then, we call it a ſtill ſoaking rain; ſometimes we have a ſtrong mighty rain; at another time rain is accompanied with thunder and lightning, while the ſhowres deſcend, the great Ordnance of heaven diſcharge from the clouds, and fill the air with terrour. Thus alſo it is, or ſhould be in teaching: Many ſoules require a ſtill, ſoft, quiet rain: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers muſt have ſtronger ſhowres, mighty raine, you muſt <hi>powre down</hi> upon them. A third ſort muſt have thunder joyned with rain, they need a <hi>Boanerges,</hi> a ſonne of thunder, a mixture of terrour with inſtruction to bore their eares, and break their hearts. Thoſe teachers miſtake their work, who in ſtead of raining are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thundering and lightning. As if their pulpit were ſet upon Mount Sinai. And I believe, it is as great a miſtake to think Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers need never thunder. The word of God in all parts of it, and in all manner of diſpenſations of it, is exceeding uſeful. A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter without teaching, is (as <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>a cloud without water;</hi> And he ſhall doe but little good upon ſome, if he have nothing but <hi>water in his cloud.</hi> Fire ſometime muſt mingle with the rain, and a Tempeſt come after or before the dewing, diſtilling, ſtill voice. The word of God is compared to fire, as well as unto water. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it muſt be the wiſdome, and it is the duty, of every Teacher, to
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:40455:270"/> know how to give every one his portion, or as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> counſels, ver. 22, 23. <hi>Of ſome to have compaſſion, making a difference, and others to ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire:</hi> A difference muſt be made, ſome are to be dealt with compaſſionately, and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rained upon; others, muſt be ſaved with fear, that is, they muſt be made afraid with thunder and lightning, with ſtormy and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous doctrine. <hi>Some ſpirits will not be kept out of the fire, but by caſting them into the fire;</hi> ſo much that text in <hi>Jude</hi> imports. <hi>Others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire,</hi> As if he had ſaid, your ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying them with the fire, will be as a pulling them out of the fire, A ſhowre of ſpiritual brimſtone (ſuch as God rained on <hi>Sodom</hi> in the letter) is beſt for them, if you ſpare them, you deſtroy them.</p>

A godly man loves not to be at his own diſpoſing, nor at his own <hi>Tutoring; He that will learn of none, but himſelf, hath (ſure enough) a fool to his Maſter; And there is more hope of a fool, then of him, that is (thus) wiſe in his own conceit, Pro</hi> 26. 12. Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A teachable ſpirit is an excellent ſpirit.</hi> A man that is willing to be taught, is in a better condition then many, who are able to teach. It argues a holier temper of the heart, to be willing to be taught, than to be able to teach. And it is far worſe to be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to learn, then not to be knowing; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nteachableneſſe is more dangerous then ignorance.</hi> It is ſad to conſider how unteachable many are, they will not be taught, or they think they have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all, they have devoured all knowledge; they are full and need no more; ſome deceived ſouls (and they moſt) carry it, as if they had a ſpirit of infallibility, what, teach them? they are above teaching. It is a ſweet frame of ſpirit, when a man ſees he may be out of frame. He is in a fair way to truth, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges he may be in an errour. And he who will not acknowledge that he may be in an error, is certainly out of the way of truth. The Apoſtle reſolves it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>If any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing, yet, as he ought to know.</hi> Not as if the Apoſtles meaning were, that all knowledge muſt be ſceptical or uncertain, all in quaeries, and nothing in concluſions, that we ſhould halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two opinions, and hang like meteors in the air. Nor doth he commend to us that proud modeſty, which will not let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, we know what we know; but his mind is, to meet with thoſe, who think they know any thing ſo well, that they need not, or cannot know it better, and abound ſo in their own ſence, that they have no room to admit the ſence of others. As he, who thinks himſelfe ſo good, that he cannot be better, was never ſo good, as he ſhould; ſo, he that thinks he knows ſo much, that he can learn no more, knowes nothing as he ought. It is beſt to be fixed in judgement, but it is very ill to be fixed in opinion. <hi>It is</hi>
                     <pb n="529" facs="tcp:40455:271"/> 
                     <hi>to be feared that man is much divorced from right reaſon, who is ſo married to his own, that he reſolves, nothing but death ſhall part him and his opinion.</hi> What if this man have eſpouſed a fancy of his own, not any truth of God? To be ſo fixed, that a man may be fixed in evil, it is as dangerous, as, to be ſo unfixed, that he may be unfixed in good. It was a high breathing of holineſs, when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid, Pſal. 57. 7. <hi>My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed:</hi> While we are upon a known duty, or have known truth on our ſide, our hearts cannot be too much fixed &amp; ſet upon them. To be of an unfixed, moveable, wavering ſpirit in goodneſſe, is within one degree of falling into evil; but to ſay, <hi>I am fixed, I am fixed, I am reſolved, reſolved,</hi> when yet things are doubful and under diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult diſpute, is actually to be in an errour, though poſſibly, the thing we fix on, be a truth. The Apoſtle cautions his <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and us in them, Chap. 4. 14. <hi>That they and we, be not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth children toſſed too and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine,</hi> and yet they are under a rebuke, who will not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any wind of doctrine; that is, let never ſo powerful and forcible a wind of truth, breath and blow upon them, they will not be carried or moved in judgement by it.

                     <hi>Silence becometh learners.</hi> Yet not all ſilence. There is a ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king helpful to learning. To move doubts is the way to be reſolved and to ask the queſtion, the readieſt means for inſtruction. But he that will have all the talk, ſhall have but little profit. The ear is the Organ of diſcipline: Hearing is the ſence of learning, and the ſeaſonable ſtopping of our own mouths, a ready means to open our underſtandings. To be, <hi>ſwift to hear, and flow to ſpeak (James.</hi> 1. 19.) is the ſpeedieſt way to attain wiſdom. Fourthly obſerve,</p>

                     <hi>He that is ſhewed his errour, ſhould ſpeak no more, but ſit down convinced. Teach me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) and I will hold my tongue;</hi> That is, I will reply no more upon you, I will never ſtand up in maintaining an errour; I wil be no pattern of evil, though my ſelf am in the fault. Errour ſhall not be excuſed; or a miſtake apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gized for, by me. Some wits are able to make a fair cover for, and put a gloſſe upon the moſt deformed and groſſeſt errours. There was never any opinion in the world, but ſome have ſeconded it, and undertaken it's protection. <hi>When conſcience hath never a word to ſay, wit will be very talkative,</hi> and when they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

A ſubtil Sophiſter will deſpute any thing, and bring probable arguments (where reaſon alone ſits judge) againſt the moſt undoubted truths. It is an ill office to be an Oratour for our own or others errous, for our own or others ſinful practiſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 32. <hi>If thou haſt done evil in lifting up thy ſelfe, or if thou hast thought evil</hi> (or maintained evil) <hi>lay thine hand upon thy mouth;</hi> ſpeake no more, never be an advocate in a bad cauſe, though it be thine own; when our faults are ſhewed us, we ſhould not open our mouths, unleſſe it be to renounce and diſclaim them. A ſad account will be given of that time, and of thoſe parts, which have been laid out in the patronage of our failings and miſtakes. It is as ſinful to few figg-leaves, or make fair pretexts to cover the nakedneſſe of our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as of our practiſes.</p>

                  <q>Cauſe me to underſtand.</q>
                  <p>It is but one word in the Original, and it ſignifies to convince
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:40455:272"/> by reaſon or argument. <hi>Cauſe me to underſtand,</hi> that is, doe not think to force my opinion, or to offer violence to my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doe not think to club me down with great words and clomorous threats, but doe it by ſolid Arguments, by evident demonſtration of reaſon; Doe it by ſavourie advices and counſel, not by bitter reproaches and invectives. Deal with my underſtanding, not barely with my affections, <hi>Cauſe me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My errour</hi>] It ſignifies local, corporal wandrings and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and bodily erring or wandring; and ſometimes it ſignifies the wandrings of the mind, judgement and affections, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 19, 20. <hi>Solomon</hi> bids the husband, <hi>Rejoyce in the wife of his youth, let her be as a loving Hind and pleaſant Roe, let her breaſts ſatisfie thee at all times, and be thou raviſhed alwayes with her love.</hi> The Hebrew (as our Tranſlatours put in the margin) is, <hi>erre thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in her love;</hi> that is, let all thy wandring, erring thoughts and affections be reduced and brought home to the wife, whom God hath given thee, the next words ſeeme to interpret ſo, <hi>for why (my ſonne) wilt thou be raviſhed with a ſtrange woman, and imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger?</hi> That's dangerous erring in love: Therefore (ſaith he) let all thine errings and wandrings, all thy delights and raviſhments be (chaſt and conjugal) <hi>towards the wife of thy youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further it ſignifies erring or wandring out of meer ignorance. This word is often uſed in <hi>Leviticus</hi> for the ſin of ignorance, Chap. 4. 2. and Chap. 5. 18. and Chap. 22. 14. <hi>If any man hath ſinned through ignorance or committed an errour, then he ſhall offer theſe and theſe ſacrifices and oblations.</hi> So Pſal. 19. 12. <hi>who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his errours;</hi> That is, thoſe ſinnes, which he commits out of ignorance and inadvertency? Hence he concludes with this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults.</hi> He doth not mean faults, which he committed privately, and ſo were ſecrets to others, but faults which he had committed ignorantly, and ſo were <hi>Secrets</hi> to himſelfe: That is, they were ſinnes of ignorance. And I conceive he means, not only ſuch ſins, as he had committed ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly, but then knew they were ſins, but even ſuch ſins, as he was ignorant, whether ever he had committed them or no; That is, he prayes for the pardon of all thoſe ſins, which poſſible he might have committed, though to him, as yet altogether unknown and undiſcovered.</p>

                  <p> The title of the 7th <hi>Pſalm.</hi> is <hi>Shiggaion of David;</hi> it is the ſame Original word we have in the text, and ſome tranſlate it, <hi>awandring ſong;</hi> And the reaſon for it, is either becauſe of the <note place="margin">Cantio erratica.</note> variable and wandring poetry, or becauſe of the variable or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring tune in which that <hi>Pſalm</hi> was ſung, and to which it was ſet for greater delight; others makes the title (ſutable to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the word here) <hi>the Pſalm of Davids errours,</hi> becauſe, ſets forth his fears and dangers, which made him wonder in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſometime alſo, to go a little aſtray in mind; this <hi>Pſalm</hi> was ſung to the Lord, concerning the words or the buſineſs of <hi>Cuſh the Benjamite,</hi> that is, of <hi>Saul,</hi> who was of <hi>Kiſh</hi> and of <hi>Jemini</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 1.) called here <hi>Cuſh,</hi> that is, <hi>Ethiopian or Blackmore</hi> (figuratively) from his black and ill conditions, his heart not being changed, as the Blackmore changeth not his skin. <hi>Saul</hi> was a bitter enemy to <hi>David,</hi> and made him flie and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſometime go aſtray in his ſpeeches and actions, upon a ſudden guſt of temptation. And ſo a Pſalm of that ſubject may well bear this ſtile, either from his corporal or ſpiritual errours. There is a third apprehenſion upon <hi>Siggaion,</hi> taking it for delight and raviſhments of mind, and ſo the Pſalm is ſuperſcribed, <hi>Davids delight or ſolace;</hi> That is, the Pſalm which he compoſed and ſung to the Lord, to comfort himſelf in all his troubles with <hi>Saul;</hi> his ſoul wandred heaven-ward in holy raviſhments and delights in God, while his body wandred about the earth in aſtoniſhment and ſorrows, cauſed by a bloody-minded man.</p>
                  <p>The very ſame title is given to the prayer of <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> chap. 3. 1. <hi>A prayer of Habakkuk upon Sigionoth,</hi> which ſome interpret to be ſo called becauſe of the ſtrange variety or variableneſs of the ſong and tune, the Prophet being in a holy rapture, raviſhed in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſwallowed up in the contemplation of Gods power and majeſty ſoars up and wanders (like <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe) he knowes not whither or how.</p>
                  <p>But the vulgar renders it, <hi>a prayer for ignorance,</hi> or a prayer for <note place="margin">Oratio pro igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantijs.</note> errour; which tranſlation is ſurely an errour, if not an ignorance, as to the ſcope of that prayer: Though the letter of the Original word (as in the former inſtances, and in the text before us) bears that ſence.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cauſe me to understand my errour,</hi> his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that his errours (whatſoever they were) in that buſineſs were ſecret to him, he had not gone againſt the light of his own
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:40455:273"/> conſcience, nor as yet, had they brought any light to convince his conſcience; he had been charged with errours, extravagancies and wandrings; But he underſtood not what they were, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſires them to cauſe him to underſtand his errour. Obſerve hence, firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man is ſubject to errour.</hi> To errour in ſpeech, to errour in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, to errour in judgement. Man by nature, can do nothing elſe but erre, <hi>all his goings are goings astray,</hi> and all his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is bottomed upon a heap of falſe principles. <hi>All his works (by nature) are errata's, and the whole edition of his life, a continued miſtake.</hi> Secondly obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That man is in a fair way to truth, who acknowledgeth he may erre. Cauſe me to understand wherein I have erred,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job;</hi> He thought he had not erred, but he grants it was poſſible for him to erre. That which hath faſtened ſo many errous to the <hi>Popes chaire,</hi> and from thence ſcattered them over all the world, is an opinion, that he, in his chair cannot erre; his ſuppoſed ſpirit of infallibility, hath made him <hi>the great Deceiver,</hi> and deceived him. He that thinks he cannot erre, errs in thinking ſo, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thinks, or ſpeaks, or doth any thing, but it is an errour. He is moſt ſecured from errour, who ſuſpects he hath erred, and humbly acknowledges that he may.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may here obſerve what an errour is. <hi>An errour strictly and properly taken, is that which we hold or doe, out of bare ignorance of the Truth.</hi> It is an errour in practice, when we are ignorant of what is better to be done. An errour in opinion is, when we are ignorant of what is better for us to believe or hold; Hereſie is an errour and more, for hereſie hath theſe three things in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard of the matter, it muſt be in ſome great and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truths; The word <hi>Hereſie,</hi> is by ſome derived from <hi>chooſing,</hi> by others, from <hi>taking away,</hi> becauſe it takes us off from Chriſt, or from the foundations of ſaving knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereſie is accompanied with pertinacy and obſtinacy, after clear light offered; It is poſſible, one may have an errour about things which are fundamental, and yet be no heretick: <hi>An he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick is condemned of himſelf,</hi> Tit. 3. 10. But he will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by another. Not that he doth formally and in terms give ſentence againſt, or condemn himſelf, but equivalently he doth, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts.</hi> 13. 46. ſpeakes to the unbeleeving <hi>Jews, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="534" facs="tcp:40455:274"/> 
                     <hi>ye put the word from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlasting life, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe men did not judge themſelves ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, they came not to the Apoſtle and ſaid, we willingly ſubmit our ſelves to hell and wrath; No, they thought very well of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and judged themſelves worthy of eternal life. But their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice judged them, and gave a real ſentance againſt them, while they acquitted themſelves: Thus alſo a heretick (who ever hath a very high opinion of himſelf and his opinions) is condemned of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In hereſie there, is taken of pleaſure and delight, therefore he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie is numbred among the <hi>luſts of the fleſh, adultery and fornication,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 5 20. Hereticks deſire to diſperſe and vend their opinions. A man onely in an errour, will weep over his opinions, and it grieves him that he diſſents and goes contrary unto others. But he that ſtiffely maintains an errour, inſults over others, and delights to maintain his oppoſition: he triumphs and boaſts of his war, though he can never obtain victory (Truth onely is victorious.) And ſome learned Criticks obſerve as much, from the form of the <note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>An erring brother or friend, muſt not be importuned barely to leave his errour, but he muſt be made to underſtand his errour.</hi> Errour ſhould not be left, nor truth received blind-fold; a man may ſin in leaving an errour: they do (without queſtion) who lay it down thinking it to be a truth; and there is little queſtion, but they do, who leave it before they underſtand it to be an errour. <hi>It is much alike to reject an opinion as an errour, which we doe not underſtand, and to practice an opinion for a truth, which we doe not understand;</hi> If a man practice or beleeve a truth, not convinced that it is, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it to be a truth, that truth is but as an errour, to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not beleeve or practice it under the notion of a truth: and ſo, if he leave an errour, which he is not convinced to be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, his leaving it is not much better (and in ſome caſes it may be worſe) then his holding it; becauſe he leaves it not under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an errour. We muſt not dance after other mens pipes, or ſee with other mens eyes: Except we know it is good we do, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil which we leave und on, our not doing evil, is not good to us, and
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:40455:274"/> our doing good is (to us) no better then evil.</p>

The Apoſtle gives this honour to all the word of God (which is all right) that it is <hi>mighty, or forcible, through God, to bring down ſtrong holds, and to bring every thought into ſubjection unto Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>The word of God is mighty in operation.</hi> The energie of it is ſuch, that nothing can ſtand before it, no luſt can ſtand before it, no errour can ſtand before it, it bears down all with fine force.</p>
                  <p>Therefore take heed of ſtanding in the way of right words. Truth comes with ſuch a force, that no man is able to beare up againſt it. <hi>It is better to have all the men of the world againſt us, Than to have one word of God againſt us.</hi> One word of truth will doe more againſt us, than all the Armies in the world, no force can ſtand againſt this force, the force of the word will deſtroy the force of the ſword. <hi>Truth will be the great Conquerour at laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="538" facs="tcp:40455:276"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, Take it in the Concrete, in reference to the ſpeaker, <hi>How forcible is the word of an upright man!</hi> Then Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The words of one, that is upright hearted, carry great ſtrength and power with them.</hi> Truth loſes by the patronage and defence which ſome give it. Truth gets little by the tongues of thoſe men, who have no grace in their hearts. Truth in the mouth of a wicked man, is weakened by the falſeneſs of his heart, and filthineſs of his life. Sometimes precious truths are ſpoken by vileſt men, but what force have they? they are not received or owned. Chriſt could not abide to hear the Devil ſpeak truth. A godly man ſpeakes <hi>with Authority,</hi> as it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He ſpake as one having authority, and not as the Scribes;</hi> the Scribes taught that which was truth, ſometimes, and the Scribes had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes authority to teach, the <hi>chair of Moſes was theirs,</hi> they were not intruders upon an office they had no call to. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Scribes and Phariſes ſit in Moſes chair (Matt.</hi> 23. 2.) He ſpeakes not onely <hi>(de facto)</hi> of what they did, but <hi>(de jure)</hi> of what they had right to doe; They were not uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or actors beyond their line. But though the Scribes had the right of authority to teach, yet their teaching had no force of authority, it was but talke. And it appears plainly, that the words of that hypocritical generation, the Scribes and Phariſees bare no weight with the people, becauſe Chriſt gives them a charge, <hi>to obſerve and doe what the Scribes and Phariſees bid them:</hi> As intimating that the doctrine of thoſe Scribes (though true) was low-priz'd and lay much unpractis'd, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 3. We muſt not ſhorten the hand of God, as if he might not uſe thoſe who have no truth, to publiſh a truth; He may imploy what inſtruments he pleaſes, and he can make thoſe that are evil, inſtruments of good. But look upon it ordinarily, thus it is, the word of truth hath moſt power, ſtrength and force from the lips of thoſe, who are upright in heart, and holy in life. <hi>How forcible are their words?</hi> The words of the wiſe, are like goads, or like nailes, faſtened by the Maſters of the Aſſembly, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. But the words of wicked maſters in the aſſembly, are like nailes without points, they will not drive, or take hold, there is no faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them; Or the words of wicked men are like weak nailes, which break in the driving: What doe you arguing, reproving, teaching, you that carry your ſelves thus, what force have your words? Truth loſes both ſtrength and credit in your mouthes:
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:40455:276"/> 
                     <hi>Thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? thou that preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteal, doeſt thou ſteal? thou that ſayeſt a man ſhould not commit adultery, doest thou commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, &amp;c?</hi> are the Apoſtles chiding expoſtulations with the Jewiſh Doctors, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. And upon this he charges them with diſhonoring God, and cauſing his name to be blaſphemed among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 24. But what was the blaſphemy? Surely this, The Gentiles grew to have a low eſteeme of the word of God, his Law was of no force with them, becauſe thoſe teachers were ſo falſe to it, and unſpoke with their lives, whatſoever their tongues had ſpoken. That which hath no force upon the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers heart, hath ſeldome any upon the hearers. What doe your teachings teach, or your comfortings comfort? what doe your arguings argue, or your reprovings reproove? <hi>Shall vice reprove ſin?</hi> as we ſpeake proverbially: or if it doth, ſin is not much hurt with thoſe reprofs. Words ſpoken from the heart, goe to the heart, and words read in the life, are moſt forcible to reforme the life; <hi>Then the word goes forth cloathed with liſt and power when the preacher can reade his Sermon in his own heart, and the people in his life. He that ſpeakes onely out of books, does much after his rate, who (as we ſay) ſpeakes without book, And he that lives not what he ſpeakes (what in him lies) kills what he ſpeakes. And how ſhall ſuch a dead letter (tis almoſt a miracle if it doth) conveigh a quickning ſpirit?</hi> Such arguings, ſeldome reprove any but the arguer, and him they alwayes reprove.</p>

                  <p>IN the two former verſes, <hi>Job</hi> made an humble ſubmiſſion of himſelf unto the better counſel and inſtruction of his friends, if they could yet ſhew him wherein he had erred. In theſe five verſes, he doth two things, further.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he expoſtulates with his friends about their former ſpeech and carriage toward him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he admoniſhes them to be better adviſed, more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and conſiderate, in what they had yet to ſay unto him.</p>
                  <p>The former of theſe is contained in the 26. and 27. verſes. And there are two branches of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He taxes them for making ſo light of what he had ſaid, <hi>Doe ye imagine to reprove words, and the ſpeeches of one that is deſperate, which are as wind?</hi> ver. 26.</p>

It is an eaſie and a compendious way of refuting all a man can ſay, to ſay he is mad.

                  </p>

And ſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>The Prophet ſhall become wind;</hi> That is, their prophecies ſhall become wind; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſpeak (ſaid that unbelieving people) ſhall be put as a vain thing, it ſhall be as nothing, it ſhall paſs away, and the place of it ſhall be known no more; Thus they undervalued the Prophets in thoſe times, when they ſpake the truth of God, and brought them immediate meſſages from heaven. Hence obſerve; Firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That words without reaſon, meer vain words, are no words, they are but wind.</hi>

Indeed the Lord anſwers for his Prophets, at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, telling the people, becauſe they had thus diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his meſſengers, that they ſhould find thoſe words, which they accounted wind, to be a fire, <hi>Thus, ſaith the Lord, becauſe ye ſpeak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it ſhall devour them.</hi> Whoſoever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems the word of God to be wind, ſhall find it to be a fire: and they who will not be taught by it, ſhall be conſumed by it. But to the point in hand, we ſee in that Scripture vain words are windie words, and windie words as are no words: <hi>The Prophets</hi> (as they ſuppoſed) <hi>were wind,</hi> and thence they inferre, <hi>the word is not in them:</hi> That is, their words have no ſubſtance, ſtrength or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at all in them. So, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the East-wind;</hi> What was the wind that <hi>Ephraim</hi> fed upon? Some vain words, ſome promiſes, he had from the creature to be delivered, ſome hopes raiſed by the word of man, who is a wind; therefore his feeding upon thoſe hopes, was but a feeding upon wind, there was no ground or ſtrength to make thoſe

                  <p>Such words doe no work: they are wind, and they paſſe away like wind without any impreſſion, upon the hearers. They trouble the eare, but touch not the heart. When the noiſe of them is paſt, all is paſt. They are a ſound, and beſides that, a nothing. Windy meats are not nouriſhing for the body, neither are windy words for the ſoul.

                     <hi>We are apt to judge the words of thoſe that are greatly afflicted, to be but vain windy words.</hi> And we are ready to conclude, they complaine more then they need.

Fourthly, hence note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is very ſinfull to eſteem the words of the afflicted to be but wind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was great uncharitableneſſe in <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, thus to expound
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:40455:279"/> and gloſſe the text of his complaints. We ſhould heare a man in affliction; as if every word were drenched and ſteeped in the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of his heart; and take every ſentence, as coming bloudy from his wounded ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, obſerve, how <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes his own eſtate, he was, as a man deſperate (not utterly deſperate, for in another place he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes in higheſt confidence, that though God kill him, yet he will truſt in him) yet deſperate he was in regard of outward help, or temporal ſuccour.</p>

                  <p>Taking the word ſo, the meaning of the clauſe may be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, <hi>You overwhelm the fatherleſse, yea you are not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that, but you feaſt upon your poor friend,</hi> that is, you rejoyce in his miſery, and make your ſelves merry with his ſorrows; as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> dealt with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when they had put out his eyes, <hi>Come let us bring him out and make ſport with him;</hi> So ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> you deal with me, you oppreſſe me, and then make your ſelves merry with my ſorrows. The teares of an oppreſſed poor man, are as wine to the oppreſſour, he drinks them down; the groans of a poor man are as muſick to a wicked oppreſſour, and his fleſh is as meat to him.

They who have leaſt help in themſelves, have uſually leaſt help from others, and often receive moſt hurt from others. Hence we find <hi>(Pſ.</hi> 10. 18) the oppreſſed and the fatherleſs put together; as if the fatherleſs were to expect oppreſſion for their portion, and they who needed moſt protection, ſhould be ſure to find moſt vexation. We uſe to ſay, where the hedge is loweſt, there men goe over; it is ſo in every daies experience. The mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> ride over the backs of the poor. And where the hedge is low, they make low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gaps, to paſs over more eaſily to their own deſignes. This ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of oppreſſion is deſcribed raging againſt thoſe, who are under heavieſt preſſures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 26. <hi>They perſecute him whom thou hast ſmitten, and they talk to the grief of thoſe whom thou hast wounded:</hi> When wicked men ſee a man afflicted by the hand of
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:40455:281"/> God, they afflict him more; when they ſee God hath wounded him, they will kill him. The trouble he is in, makes their victory more eaſie; As when the Philiſtines fell before <hi>Jonathan</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.) his Armour-bearer ſlew after him; ſo do theſe, they ſlay thoſe who are fallen before the afflicting hand of God. Obſerve ſecondly;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is a great aggravation of the ſinfulneſſe of oppreſſion and wrong doing, to oppreſſe or do wrong to the fatherleſſe.</hi> Commonly the poor are moſt oppreſſed, but alwayes there is more ſinne in oppreſſing the poor, though to oppreſſe or wrong the rich be a ſin, and a very great one. What a ſtock of wickedneſſe doe they gather, who take from theſe to whom they are bound to give, who make them naked and hungry, whom they ſhould cloath and feed: who are ſtraitened in juſtice towards them, to whom they ought to be enlarged in charity. It is a ſin to deny them juſtice, who need not your charity, but to be unjuſt where we ſhould be charitable, how ſinful is that! It is a great ſin to take away from him, who hath aboundance, but to take away from him, who is in want, is an abounding ſin. Therefore we find that given, not only as a rule, but as a charge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22 22. <hi>Rob not the poor becauſe he is poor,</hi> make not poverty your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for robbery. There is much baſeneſs in it (beſides the ſinfulneſs) to trample upon thoſe who cannot reſiſt, and perhaps dare not complain. God is moſt reſiſted in wronging thoſe who cannot reſiſt others, or right themſelves. When we help a poor man (eſpecially a godly poor man) God himſelf gaines, and (in a ſence) is inriched by it; becauſe God receives glory, and is paid (which is his greateſt revenew from man) in honour and in praiſe, for all the help we give ſuch poor. In our alms, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Gods promiſes for him; and they who receive premiſes, cannot but return praiſe. On the other ſide, when we wrong the poor (eſpecially the godly poore) God himſelf looſes, and (in a ſence) is impoveriſhed; becauſe not onely his praiſe (as much as we can doe) is with-held, but his truth and faithfulneſſe are queſtioned. Mans uncharitableneſs, would make void, the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God; and when promiſes lye unfulfilled, praiſe lyes unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. Hence that threatning prohibition, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 10, 11. <hi>Enter not into the fields of the fatherleſse;</hi> that is, make not a forcible or violent entry. Why, is it more dangerous to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his field, than into anothers? Or is there any licenſe here to
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:40455:282"/> enter into the field of a rich man, or to treſpaſſe upon him? No, there is no licenſe to treſpaſs upon a rich man, or to enter upon his field, but take heed you enter not into the fields of the fatherleſs; why? <hi>For their Redeemer is mighty, he ſhall plead their cauſe with thee;</hi> Though poor orphans and fatherleſs have no might, no help, they cannot plead themſelves, and they have no friend to help or plead for them, they cannot get an Advocate or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour ſpeak in their cauſe, <hi>Yet their redeemer is strong, he will plead with thee;</hi> He will plead with thee, for the wrong done the fatherleſſe, as for a wrong done himſelf, becauſe thou haſt oppreſt one, whom he undertook to protect, and ſo (as much as thou canſt) haſt brought up an ill report upon the Lord, as if he were either forgetful of his word, or unable to accompliſh it. <hi>We vex and tear the promiſes of God, every time we vex and teare the poor of God.</hi> How ſinful then is this ſin; by which at once we break the command, which God gives us, to relieve the poor, and weaken the promiſe, which God hath given the poor, that they ſhall be relieved.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve further from that expreſſion of their cunning dealing with him, <hi>You digge a pit for your friend; deceitfull words are as pits and ſnares to catch men in: The tongue is a great inſnarer.</hi> The tongue teacheth to lay a ſnare, <hi>Balaam taught Balak to lay a ſtumbling block before the children of Iſrael, Revel.</hi> 2. 14. He taught him how to dig a pit, and ſet ſuch a ſnare, as catcht the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into adultery and Idolatry: The tongue is a great Engineer, a trap-ſetter to catch and intangle both the eſtates and ſouls of men.</p>
                  <p>And we may note another point, from the relation of the perſon for whom this pit was digged, <hi>You dig a pit for your friend. It is a great aggravation of unkindneſs, to endeavour their hurt, to whom we are bound by many names and obligations to doe good, or to whom we have made profeſſion of our readineſs to doe them good.</hi> The more duty or reſpect we owe any man, the more is our ſin when we neglect him.</p>

                  <p>We may obſerve from this paſſage, firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That uprightneſſe hath much boldneſſe.</hi> He that hath a good cauſe and a good conſcience, is not afraid to be ſearched to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome; he cares not who lookes upon him, or who lookes into him. <hi>David</hi> in regard of the uprightneſſe of his heart, calls unto God himſelf, <hi>Search me, and try me, it there be any way of wickedneſſe in me,</hi> Pſal. 139. 23. <hi>David</hi> was ſo aſſured at his own integrity, that he was not afraide to put him ſelf upon the higheſt triall, in that point: A holy heart is willing, that God and men ſhould ſearch it; even ſearch it with candles, as God threatens he would, the corrupt and falſe-hearted Jews.</p>

<pb n="554" facs="tcp:40455:284"/> one time or other; you may cover and hide a lie, you may keep it, cloſe, and ſit upon it, as <hi>Rachel</hi> upon her fathers Images, but at laſt it will be evident, a lie will out.

                  <p>Take the word in the other ſence, for failing, and it yeelds us this Inſtruction. That.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He who hath uprightneſſe of heart, is ſtedfaſt for ever.</hi> Truth is uniforme: Which way ſoever the wind and the world turne, his poſture is the ſame, Chriſt will not faile him, and therefore he cannot. Such a man is as Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> that ſhall never be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; when the heart is ſound, the actions are ſteady; and he that moves upon a right principle, moves regularly; and in all changes of events, changes not his way: try him, and try him again, it will be evident unto you, he will not lie. Grace is ever the ſame, and renders them who have it, like him (in their degree) from whom they have it, <hi>without variableneſſe or ſhadow of turning.</hi> He that is not (for the ſubſtance) what he was, was never what he ought to be, ſincere. He that is upon a good ground, and knowes his ground, will ſtand to it; truſt him (as a creature may be truſted) and he will not faile.</p>

                  <p> Secondly, obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To perſiſt in evill is worſe than the committing if evill.</hi> The one is common to man, the other peculiar to the Devill, and his peculiars, who know no repentance. It is bad enough to doe ill, but not to returne from evill, is inexcuſable; therefore the Lord, often by his Prophets laies this, as the heavieſt charge of all, upon his people. He taxes them with their departures from him: But eſpecially with their refuſals to returne unto him, <hi>Yet have ye not returned unto me;</hi> this is more ſinfull than all the ſins you have committed, you have not returned, you goe on and perſevere in evill. The ſword of God proclaimes alike voice in our eares at this day, <hi>Return, return again.</hi> We have departed and gone away from God, let us not draw that ancient change upon our ſelves, I have ſmitten you, <hi>yet have ye not returned unto me.</hi> It is not ſinning, but not returning, which brings finall condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>impenitency ſeales the ſtone of deſtruction upon Perſons, and Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas theſe words, <hi>Returne, let it not be iniquity,</hi> are referred to <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Let not this your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion make your ſinne fouler and greater;</hi> you have ſinned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, but if you returne not, your ſin will be iniquity ſhortly, Note,</p>

                  <p>Every ſin, the leaſt ſin, is ſin, as the leaſt drop of water, is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but every ſin (in a ſtrict ſence) is not iniquity.

                  <p>Fourthly, obſerve further, how <hi>Job</hi> cals upon his friends, when he ſees them tranſported (as he thought) with paſſion; he leaves complaining of his owne ſorrowes, and gives them good counſell; he, for that preſent forgets his owne ruines, that he might amend them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is our duty to reclaime, and to appeaſe thoſe by gentle intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who, we ſuppoſe, have wronged us, or gone aſtray from truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> doth not raile upon or revile his friends, but beſeeches them, to be better adviſed, and conſider what they did.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in that he ſaith, <hi>Return, yea return again,</hi> taking this
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:40455:286"/> for a call to a more ſerious conſideration of the buſineſſe, we may note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a mans cauſe and condition must be conſidered, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered again, twice, that is, fully conſidered, before he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> We muſt give account of every idle word, much more then of every unjuſt ſentence or cenſure: It is but wiſdome to conſider that ſtrictly, about which we muſt give ſo ſtrict an account.</p>

Search a godly man, and the lower you goe, the better he proves; the nearer you come to his heart, the richer treaſures of grace and uprightneſſe will be diſcovered. at his tongue, or, his lips may be gilded over with good words, but Whereas take an hypocrite, and you may have a little good mettal, ſearch him to the bottome, and there is all rottenneſſe, even ſeven abominations at his heart. <hi>A godly man is not gilded, but gold.</hi> Search a <hi>Job</hi> quite through, try him to the center, righteouſneſſe is in all his wayes, the further you ſearch, the better he is, and he will be beſt of all, at laſt.</p>

                     <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand perverſe things?</hi> It is uſuall in Scripture to aſcribe underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, not onely to the ſenſes, but alſo to the tongue, and ſometimes to the hand. Underſtanding is aſcribed to the tongue, in the place before named: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. where the tongue is ſaid, to <hi>de viſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe;</hi> The tongue, properly, cannot deviſe, the tongue doth but utter miſchiefe, it is the mind or heart that deviſeth. The ſhop is within, where miſchiefe is forged and framed, yet the contrivance of it, is in that text given to the tongue. There is a two-fold rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, why the holy Ghoſt attributes the worke of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the tongue, hand or ſenſes,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a great affinity, beween reaſon and ſpeech, and therefore the tongue, which is the inſtrument of ſpeech, is honoured with the worke of the underſtanding: And ſo grat is the affinity beween reaſon and ſpeech, that no creature void of reaſon can ſpeak; Speech is a peculiar property of the rationall creature, <hi>Speech is or ought to be the immediate iſſue or birth of reaſon.</hi> Words are conceived in the mind, and born at the tongue. And words are the image of the mind. We may ſee what work is wrought in the mind, by that which is ſpoken by the tongue. The ſhape of a mans heart (when he ſpeakes himſelf) comes out at his mouth. And therefore before a man ſpeakes, he meditates. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is the conception of words. As ſpeaking is the production of them. Thus the Lord charges <hi>Joſhua</hi> (Chap. 1. 8.) <hi>The book of the law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate therein day and night:</hi> One would think, it ſhould rather
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:40455:287"/> have been ſaid, <hi>The book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thine heart, but thou ſhalt meditate therein, or if, not cut of thy mouth, then</hi>

                     <hi>thou ſhalt ſpeak of it.</hi> Meditation is too high a worke for the mouth, Yet, becauſe there ought to be much meditation about the Law of God, before a word of it comes out of the mouth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord ſaith, <hi>The book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night;</hi> that is, as oft as thou ſhalt ſpeak, thou ſhalt meditate, thou ſhalt not ſpeake raſhly, it ſhall not be the work of thy tongue alone, but of thy mind and tongue together.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſecond reaſon, why, acts of the underſtanding are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the tongue, or to the ſenſes; becauſe when a thing is well ſpoken, or duly acted by any ſenſe, Reaſon is the guide and the bodily Organ is under the dictates of the minde or underſtanding. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 14. when old <hi>Jacob</hi> in giving the bleſſing unto <hi>Joſephs</hi> children, <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> laid his right hand upon the younger, and his left hand upon the elder, the text ſaith, he made <hi>his hands to underſtand,</hi> we tranſlate, <hi>he guided his hands witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> there was ſo much reaſon, ſuch divine reaſon in that act of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> hands, in laying his right-hand upon the younger, that the <note place="margin">

                  <p>Yet further, it is frequent in Scripture metaphorically to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late things, which are only acted or apprehended by the inward ſenſes, to the outward. Taſte, properly, is of meat and drink; the humour or moiſture, which is in meats, ſutable to the ſalivall
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:40455:287"/> humour in the mouth, cauſeth pleaſantneſs of taſte. Here <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of Doctrines, or of actions, <hi>Cannot my taste diſcerne perverſe things?</hi> If a thing be perverſly or properly, truely or falſely ſpoken, cannot I taſte it quickly? And hence the word of God is compared to thoſe things, which are the object of taſte, as <hi>to milk, and to ſtrong meat,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 2. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>have fed you with milk, and not with meat;</hi> That is, with eaſie and common truths, not with the more myſterious parts of Goſpel-knowledge, becauſe ye were not able to bear it. The taſte of ſuch myſteries was too ſtrong for your pallates. The ſame Metaphor is enlarged by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. And in this Book we find it more than once, <hi>Doth not the eare trie words, and the mouth taste his meat?</hi> (Job 12. 11. Chap. 34. 3.) That is, doth not the eare try words, as the mouth taſtes meat? <hi>Cannot my taste diſcern</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Perverſe things?</q>
                  <p>That is, words ill ſpoken, or wrong placed. The word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <note place="margin">

                     <hi>The tongue oft-times diſcovers the iniquity of the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be iniquity in the heart, it will one time or other break forth at, and bliſter upon the tongue. He that is rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at his heart, is commonly rotten in his talk, Matth. 12. 34. <hi>Out of the aboundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeakes.</hi> And when there is aboundance of iniquity in the heart, there is ſeldome a dearth or ſcarcity of it in the mouth: eſpecially in times of trouble, that iniquity and corruption, that diſeaſe and plague of the heart, will break forth at the lips. As, <hi>Evill words corrupt good manners;</hi> So evil words diſcover, that our manners are corrupt. There are few men, but as the Damoſel ſpake to <hi>Peter, Their ſpeech bewrayeth them,</hi> and you may ſmell the filth of their hearts by their breath.

                  <p>Thirdly, in that <hi>Job</hi> is thus ſtiff, in maintaining his own up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, and in denying any iniquity to be in his tongue, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon diſtinguiſhes truth from falſhood, as the pallate diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes bitter from ſweet.

We may be ſurfetted elſe, if not poiſon'd. There may be a wild guord among good hearbs in the pot, and ſo death in the pot too, therefore firſt taſte, then eat and digeſt. A Chriſtian hath a taſte to diſcern error from truth; why then ſhould he be denied the uſe of it? A woe is pronounced againſt thoſe, who offer unwholſome doctrin, Iſa. 5. 20 <hi>Wo to thoſe that call evil good, &amp; good evil, that put light for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and darkneſs for light, that put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter.</hi> A like wo is due to them, who will not give others leave to diſcern for themſelves, what is good or evil, light or darkneſs, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſweet; as good let another live for us, as another taſte for us. And their miſery will be little leſs, then the woes of theſe men, who cannot or will not take pains to diſtinguiſh, when evill is
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:40455:288"/> called good and good evil, when light is put for darkneſs, and darkneſs for light, when bitter is put for ſweet, and ſweet for bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks here) <hi>whoſe taſte cannot diſcern perverſe things.</hi> There are ſome whoſe taſte is ſo far from diſcerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things, that it is eaſie to diſcern, their taſte is perverſe; for, bring them wholeſome, true and ſavoury doctrine, they ſay it is bitter, or falſe doctrine; Bring them falſe doctrin, a lie, a dream a fancie, a meer humane invention, diſh out ſuch proviſion before them, that's excellent chear. This was the heavieſt curſe, which God ſent upon the Gentiles, Rom. 1. 28. God gave them over to <hi>a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things, which are not convenient,</hi> that is, to a mind void of judgement, a mind that could not taſte or diſtinguiſh things, therfore the iſſue or effect was, <hi>They did things which were not convenient;</hi> as if a man not being able to judge of meats, eats poyſon, or meats moſt contrary to his health and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. It is a fearful judgement to be given up to an unappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mind, to a mind that cannot diſcern truth from falſe-hood, the Oracles of God, from the forgeries of men, ſuperſtition, from holy worſhip. <hi>It is a ſad thing to looſe our ſpiritual ſenſes.</hi> Such as play the wantons with the word of God, and walk below the truths they know, are at laſt given up to a reprobate mind, to a mind not able to know the word of truth, and then they ſwallow down error for truth, and ſuck in deadly poiſon, like ſweet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant wine. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the difference of doctrins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the metaphor of meats, ſaith, <hi>Milk is for babes, but ſtrong meat is for them of full age, even for thoſe, that by reaſon of uſe, have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern good and evil;</hi> That is, their ſpiritual ſenſes exerciſed to taſte this, from that doctrin, and not to ſwallow every doctrin alike. It is a great bleſſing, when a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have <hi>ſenſes exerciſed;</hi> And it is a bleſſing we have much cauſe to pray for, in theſe times. That many pallats are out of taſte, is too apparent by the multitude of heterodox opinions, which go down without diſreliſh. Some, which would even make a man tremble to name them, are entertained with delight. Some, which diſſolve our comforts, and breaks us off from comfortable commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt: Some, which ſhake, if not overthrow the very foundations of faith, are ſwallowed, as pleaſant morſels. Doth not this convince, that there's a want of <hi>Jobs</hi> taſte among us, <hi>to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern perverſe things.</hi> Therefore get your ſenſes exerciſed, be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the preſent truth, that, ye, as this holy man in the middeſt
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:40455:289"/> of all bodily diſtempers, and outward troubles (which uſually put the natural pallate out of taſte) may yet even then, as he, have your inward ſenſes exquiſite, and your ſpiritual pallate exact to diſcern right from perverſe things. Laſtly, note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Falſe doctrine, or true doctrine falſely applied is a perverſe thing.</hi>

                  <p>Falſe doctrin perverts, Firſt, Reaſon; Secondly, Scripture; Thirdly, the ſouls of men.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here the knot of connection, between this and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter lyeth, is not ſo diſcernable; which hath given occaſion for much diverſity of conjecture about it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It may be conceived, that <hi>Job</hi> in his diſcourſe, refutes that tenet of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> that, he was puniſhed and ſcourged for his wickedneſs: by ſhewing, that to be afflicted is the common condition of man, and therefore no ſuch judgement of any mans wickedneſſe or ſinfulneſs could be made from his afflictions. Or,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That <hi>Job</hi> here confutes that promiſe, which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> made about the twentieth verſe of the fifth Chapter, concerning outward proſperity, <hi>He ſhall know that his tabernacle ſhall be in peace, and he ſhall be delivered, &amp;c.</hi> by proving it inconſiſtent with the preſent eſtate of mortals, to look for ſuch uninterrupted happineſs, or fair dayes without any clouds and ſtormes, as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> ſeemed to undertake he ſhould, <hi>Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his dayes alſo like the dayes of an hireling,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="566" facs="tcp:40455:290"/>
                  <p> Or thirdly, the connection may be made with theſe words, which himſelf had ſpoken at the four and twentieth verſe of the former Chapter, <hi>Teach me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) and I will hold my tongue, and cauſe me to understand wherein I have erred:</hi> In which words we ſhewed, <hi>Job</hi> makes an humble ſubmiſſion of himſelf; and in caſe his friends could inſtruct him better, he was willing to learn, he was not wedded to his own opinion, or reſolved never to be removed from it,</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of which promiſed teacheablneſs, he in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grants what was grantable in the former diſcourſe of <hi>Eliphaz. Eliphaz</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. <hi>That man was born to labour as the ſparks fly upward,</hi> and thereupon preſently inferres, <hi>I would ſeek unto God, &amp;c.</hi> both theſe, <hi>the Doctrin and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, Job</hi> ſeems to proſecute in this ſeventh Chapter, as if he ſhould ſay, what thou haſt rightly ſpoken, I will grant thee; thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Man is born to trouble,</hi> I ſay ſo too, <hi>Is there not an appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time unto man</hi> (of trouble?) <hi>and are not his daies as the daies of an hireling?</hi> And thou adviſeſt me to ſeek unto God, and apply my ſelf to him; it is good counſel, and therefore I will follow it: As we read he doth, at the ſeventeenth and twentieth verſes of this Chapter, <hi>O remember that my life is wind, what is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him; I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men? Why doeſt thou not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non my tranſgreſſion, and take away mine iniquity?</hi> Language full of humility, and ſounding out the brokenneſs of his heart.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, rather thus, <hi>Job</hi> having in the former Chapter refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe arguments, by which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> would convince him, and having renewed his requeſt to die, expoſtulated with his friends about their unkindneſs toward him, and admoniſhed them to a more equal dealing with, and hearing of him: he now proceeds to the confirmation of his firſt requeſt to die, which he doth from divers grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the general condition of mans life, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Is there not an appointed time to man, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the condition of ſome particular men, <hi>A ſervant earneſtly deſireth the ſhadow, and an hireling looketh for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his work,</hi> may not I therefore deſire death, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will be a ſhadow to me, till when, I ſhall not have my reward? And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From his own ſpecial condition at the third verſe, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:40455:290"/> to the ſeventh, therein expreſſing how ſad, how reſtleſs, how troubleſome his life was to him, which (as he apprehended) nothing could give remedy to, but onely death: <hi>My diſeaſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears curable, only by a grave, and my only medicine, is a mouth full of earth:</hi> Therefore the matter ſtanding ſo with me, have I not rightly and reaſonably deſired, either that I had not lived at all, or that I may quickly die, and that God would cut off my life.</p>
                  <p>Having by theſe arguments confirmed that former deſire; In the next place, he again renews his former complaints from the eleventh verſe of this Chapter, unto the ſeventeenth. Thirdly, he abaſes himſelf before God, as unworthy, that God ſhould take any notice of him, or beſtow a thought, a viſit, a ſmile, or a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him. <hi>What is man, that thou doeſt magnifie him? that thou doeſt viſit him, &amp;c?</hi> Laſtly, he concludes with confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſin, and earneſt deſire of pardon, at the twentieth and the one and twentieth verſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus in general, both for the dependance of the latter part of his ſpeech upon the former, and the principal parts contained in this.</p>
                  <q>Verſe 1. <hi>Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? and are not his daies alſo like the daies of an hireling.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>The queſtion affirms, there is an appointed time to man upon earth, and his daies are like the daies of an hireling. From whence, we may form his argument thus. He that hath a certain terme of life appointed him, to ſerve in, doth not ſin in deſiring an end of his ſervice: But there is an appointed time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore it is not ſinful to deſire it.</p>

                     <hi>not a warfare to man upon earth?</hi> So you find it in the margin of your Bibles: Our Tranſlators put <hi>warfare</hi> there, and <hi>Appointed time</hi> in the text. The word ſignifies both, becauſe warres of all other actions, have their ſeaſons, and their appointed times; and the life of man is well deſcribed under both, or either of thoſe notions.</p>
                  <p>Conſider it firſt under the moſt proper ſignification, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny read it, <hi>Is there not a warfare to man upon the earth?</hi> Iſa. 40. 1, 2. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, ſaith the Lord, ſpeake comfortably to Jeruſalem;</hi> Why? <hi>Tell her, her warfare is ended.</hi>
                     <pb n="568" facs="tcp:40455:291"/> In that place our tranſlators put <hi>appointed time,</hi> in the margin, and, <hi>warfare,</hi> in the text, as here they put, <hi>appointed time,</hi> in the text, and <hi>warfare,</hi> in the margin; The ſence in both is the ſame. <hi>Tell her that her warfare is ended,</hi> that is, <hi>the time appointed or constitued for her trouble is ended:</hi> So here, <hi>Is there not an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time?</hi> that is, is there not a ſet, determined time of the troubles, or troubleſome warfaring life of man?</p>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>appointed temptation to man upon the earth?</hi> And that gives us the ſame meaning; for temptation is a warfare; temptation is our ſpiritual warre, the exerciſe and probation of a Chriſtian. There are three things in which the greateſt exerciſe of a Chriſtian life conſiſts, <hi>Prayer, Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Temptation.</hi> Firſt Prayer, wherein man, is ſeeking unto, and working his heart towards God: Secondly, Meditation, wherein he is preparing himſelf, by holy thoughts and divine conſiderations, for his nearer addreſſes unto God in prayer, and how to walk in every duty towards man: Thirdly, Temptation, wherein he wraſtles and ſtrives with thoſe enemies oppoſing Prayer, Meditation, and the whole courſe of holy obedience. The life of man is a continued temptation, and that's a ſpiritual warfare, a continual bickering with a world of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; And though they without ſtand ſtill, yet a ſoul can ſcarce paſſe one hour, but he ſhall have many fights and bouts with his own heart. In this ſence, <hi>Is there not an appointed time of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare or temptation to man upon earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our life is a warfare in divers reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a warfare, becauſe Chriſtians do or ought, to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt command of any in the world; they ought to ſtand armed at a call. A Souldier is under abſolute command, he muſt not diſpute the Orders of his General, but obey them; The Centurian in the Goſpel ſaith, <hi>I have Souldiers under me, and I ſay to one go and he goeth, to another come and he cometh; and to a third do this and he doth it:</hi> which he ſpeaks not as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the ſpecial vertue and good diſpoſition of his own Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but as deſcribing the duty of all Souldiers: therefore Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary is well defined, <hi>To be the obedience of a ſtout and valiant mind,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Militia eſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia quadam fortis &amp; invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti, animi ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio carentis ſuo.</note> 
                     <hi>out of his own diſpoſe;</hi> A Souldier moves upon direction; ſo muſt a Chriſtian, he is in a warfaring condition, he muſt have a charge or a word from his Commander, for every ſtep he treads, or action he undertakes.</p>
                  <pb n="569" facs="tcp:40455:291"/>
                  <p> Secondly it is a warfare, in regard of perpetuall motions and travels: A Souldiers life is an unſetled life; while he is in actuall ſervice, he hath no reſt, he is either marching, or charging; and when he comes in his quarters, his ſtay is but little, he cannot build him a houſe, he can but pitch him down a tent for a night or two; he muſt away againe. Mans life hath no ſtop, we have here no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding City, we dwell in tents and tabernacles, waifaring and warfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out our dayes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a warfare, becauſe of continual watching. It is the <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word</hi> which Chriſt gave his followers, <hi>I ſay unto you, watch;</hi> that's the ſouldiers word and work too; warring and watching goe together: The Souldier ſtands Centinel, fearing the enemies ſurpriſe: A Chriſtian ſhould ſtand upon his guard and his watch at all hours, is not that a warfare?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a warfare, becauſe Chriſtians ought to keep their rank and file, that is, the places and relations wherein God hath ſet them. A Souldier commanded to ſtand ſuch a ground, muſt not ſtirre, though he die for it, and if he ſtirs (by Martial law) he ſhall die. There is ſo much keeping of order in warre and Battels, that whatſoever keeps order, is ſaid to fight, or warre. The Sarres are ſaid to have fought againſt <hi>Siſera</hi> in their courſes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 20. The Stars are embattaild or encampt in their ſphears, out of which they move not, and are therefore often called the <hi>Militia,</hi> or hoſt of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, a warfare, becauſe ſo full of hazzards, troubles and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or becauſe ſo much hardſhip is to be endured. A Souldier converſes with dangers, and dwels in the territories of death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: This cauſed <hi>Deborah</hi> to begin her <hi>Triumphant Song,</hi> with praiſe to the Lord, <hi>becauſe the people offered themſelves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</hi> Many are forc'd and preſs'd to the warrs; and moſt who are not preſs'd by the Authority of others, are preſs'd by their own hopes of gaine, or deſire of vain-glory and renown. <hi>A true Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiere in warre; is a rare man:</hi> There is ſo much danger in it, that there is ſeldome much of the will in it.</p>
                  <p>The whole life of man, is full either of viſible or inviſible dangers; he paſſes the pikes every day. The Apoſtle reckons eight diſtinct perlis in one verſe, which met him, which way ſoever he turned, 2 Cor. 11. 26. <hi>He was in deaths often.</hi> And though there are but few ſuch <hi>Heroes</hi> as he, yet 'tis ſeldome, but any of us are in deaths: Eſpecially while we remember, the mighty ſpirituall enemies and
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:40455:292"/> oppoſitions which encompaſſe and beſet us every day. <hi>We wraſtle not with fleſh and blood but with principalities and powers, &amp;c.</hi> And are therefore adviſed to take to us the whole armour of God; never to ſtir without our ſword.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly a warfare, in regard of the iſſue; victory and triumph, or ſlavery and death, is the iſſue of our lives. Either we overcome and are <hi>more then conquerours</hi> (that's the Apoſtles language, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.) or elſe we are conquered, and more then captives; that's the Apoſtles ſence too (both in alluſion) <hi>They are taken captive by the Devill at his will:</hi> To be led captive by the Devill, is the loweſt captivity, lower then any captivity unto men. In reference to <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.</note> the ſpirituall part of our warfare, there's no comming off upon equall rermes: We muſt be victors or ſlaves, conquer or die. Only this is the Saints aſſurance, that as the <hi>Captaine of their ſalvation was made perfect by ſufferings,</hi> and conquer'd by dying, ſo (at the worſt) ſhall they; ſpirituall death (as ſinners) hath no power over them at all, and when they die (as men) naturall, or by men violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſhall receive fuller power: Thus our life is a warfare upon earth.</p>
                  <p>But take the word as we tranſlate, <hi>for an appointed time; Is there not an appointed time to man upon the earth?</hi> And the reaſon why it beares that ſence, is grounded upon theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is a ſpeciall ſeaſon of the yeare, moſt fit and <note place="margin">Non ſignificat tempus ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer, ſed tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus certum ac conſtitutum, ea analogia quod determinato anni tempore exerceri ſolet militia. Militia ideo tempus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatum dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quia non quae vis aetas bello apta est, ſed determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta &amp; certa.</note> ſutable for warre, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>And it came to paſſe at the return of the yeare, when Kings go forth to battell.</hi> The time for war, is ſuch a known appointed ſeaſon, that the ſame word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, warfare, and any appointed ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe men go out to war, at a ſpeciall time of their age: There is an appointed ſetled time of mans life, wherein he is fit to beare arms: Every age is not fit for arms. Old men and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not fit for the field: Hence we finde, <hi>Numbers</hi> the firſt, throughout, that the muſter of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is thus made, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 20, 22, <hi>&amp;c. From twenty yeares old and upward; all that are able to goe forth to warre.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> and Greek hiſtories are diſtinct in this; In ſome Common-wealths, from Fifteen to Fifty, in others, from Twenty to Sixty: and in ours, the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time is, between Sixteen &amp; Sixty, ſo men are preſs'd and liſted for war; And becauſe there is ſuch an appointed, or a ſet time of life in all States to goe out to war, therefore, that word is

                     <hi>That the decrees of God concerning our lives, muſt not leſſen our care to preſerve our lives. Is their not an appointed time to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Non in abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum trabenda eſt haec Iobi ſententia, ut te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere ſe quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam periculis objiciat, quia ſpatium vitae definitum eſt.</note> 
                     <hi>man upon earth?</hi> Yes, that there is, man lives at Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but he muſt not live upon that appointment, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf from meanes of his preſervation, and ſay, God hath appointed how long I ſhall live, therefore what need I take care how to live? or what need I take care for the preſerving of my life? As it is in ſpirituals, ſo alſo in temporals. God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and appointed the portion of every man, all comes under a decree, under an everlaſting and unmoveable decree; yet the decree which is paſt concerning us, muſt not take us from our care about our ſelves. <hi>Though only the elect are ſaved, yet none are ſaved by their election;</hi> Infants who attaine not the uſe of reaſon, much leſſe the actings of grace, yet are not ſaved barely by election; what they cannot doe, is done for them, they are ſaved as elect in Chriſt, not preciſely as elect: how, they are united to Chriſt, we know not, but we know they muſt be united, or elſe they could not be ſaved. But they who grow in yeares, muſt alſo grow in the graces of ſanctification, otherwiſe they are not ſaved by the grace of election: The decree of God appoints us to ſalvation, but
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:40455:293"/> the decree of God doth not ſave us; we muſt runne through all the ſecond cauſes, and wayes which the word of God hath chalked out to eternal life and glory. Thus alſo our temporall life, paſſeth under a decree, it is by appointment: but woe unto thoſe that ſhall ſay, God hath appointed how long I ſhall live, therefore what need I take care about my life? This is to walk contrary to one part of the decree, while we ſeeme to ſubmit unto the other. For God who appoints life, appoints all the means which concerne the preſervation of life. It hath no ſhadow of a warrant, for any man to caſt himſelf upon needleſſe dangers, or to forbear neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry helps for the ſuſtaining of his life, becauſe he heares his time is appointed, and that his dayes one earth, are all reckoned and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to him, from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for as much as there is an appointed time, we ſhould learne patience, and wait quietly upon God. It is not in creatures (be they never ſo angry) to prolong the time of our ſorrows. The ſame word, which ſhews us, that our <hi>life is a warfare,</hi> ſhews us alſo, that it is an <hi>appointed time.</hi> Men cannot appoint you one moments trouble, or lengthen this warre, when God will ſhorten it. Our haires are numbred much more our daies. Honour God, and have good thoughts of him, for whether your times be faire or foule, calme or ſtormy, they are appointed times. The whole life of man on earth is ordered in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if our lives are for an appointed time, we ſhould be willing to die, when God cals. All the time we would live beyond that, is of our own appointment, and we ſhould be willing to live, till God cals, for all that's appointed time. As it is ſinfull not to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do (though it be burdenſom) what God appoints, ſo is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, not to be willing to live what time God appoints, though it <note place="margin">

                     <hi>An hireling.]</hi> We may take him either for a hired ſouldier, a mercenary in warre, or for an hired ſervant, a mercenary in work. An hireling in either notion is called to labour, ſorrow and ſweat;
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:40455:294"/> Such is the common condition of man, <hi>His daies, are as the daies of an bireling.</hi> God threatneth <hi>Moab</hi> by the Prophet, in this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (Iſa. 16. 14.) <hi>Within three yeares, as the years of an hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the glory of Moab ſhall be contemned;</hi> that is, within three years, which ſhall be like the years of an hireling, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome years, laborious years, vexatious yeares, weariſome yeares, and then the glory of <hi>Moab</hi> ſhall be contemned, and utterly deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, As if he had ſaid, <hi>Moab</hi> is now in great glory, but near great deſolation. You ſhall ſee three years trouble will ſtaine all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Moab,</hi> and wither all her beauty; we feele this truth, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was a Nation of great glory, you ſee how two or three years, like the years of an hireling, troubleſome years, years of affliction, years of hard labour and travell, have almoſt ſpoil'd the glory of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet here <hi>Job</hi> makes a generall deſcription of the life of man: It is not the lot only of ſome poore afflicted, hard-wrought ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that, their daies are as the daies of an hireling: he ſpeakes of man-kind, of the maſter, as well as of the ſervant, <hi>His daies are like the daies of an hireling.</hi> We may note from it, Firſt, That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Except we labour we ought not to eat;</hi> For the dayes of man, are as the daies of an hireling, the hireling ſhall not have his meat, except he worke for it, neither ought he that hires, or ſets him a worke. The maſter is in this ſence an hireling. The Saints are (in this ſence) <hi>Hirelings.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeakes to believers, and reproves them (2 Theſſ. 3. 12.) <hi>There are ſome which walke among you inordinately, working not at all, now them that are ſuch, we command, that they work and eat their own bread,</hi> and ver. 10. <hi>If any man work not, let him not eat;</hi> even they, whom Chriſt hath made free, are to account themſelves, as hired ſervants, that is, they muſt not eat the bread of idleneſſe; we ſteale all the bread, which (one way or other) we labour not for, and therefore the Apoſtle bids the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> work, that, they might <hi>eat their own bread;</hi> It is not our own bread, which we buy with our mony, unleſſe we pay (in what we can, and are called to) labour for it alſo. As we eat that bread plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, ſo we come by it honeſtly, which is dipt in our owne ſweat.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are hence taught; That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We ought to take our travels well, we muſt not murmur at our labours, or complain over our work, and ſay, what a wearineſſe is it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="575" facs="tcp:40455:294"/>
                  <p> As the Lord cannot bear it, that any ſhould murmur at ſpirituall worke, or ſay with them in the Prophet, <hi>What a wearineſſe is it;</hi> ſo it is very diſpleaſing to him, to ſay of our callings and the burdens of them, <hi>What a wearineſſe are they?</hi> Why? It is the common condition of man: Why then ſhould we quarrel with that law of labour, which is become the portion of our mortality. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature hath led us into this condition, and made us all as hirelings. Mans innocency had buſineſſe, but ſin hath brought him to ſweat, and changed his labour into toile. Man was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the garden, <hi>as Lord of it,</hi> to dreſſe and till it, but now he is put there, <hi>as an hireling,</hi> to ſweat and toyle at it. There is a ſtampe of ſervility and drudgery upon all the labours, which the children of men take under the Sun. That argument, which the Apoſtle uſes, to ſupport us, in the bitterneſſe of affliction, hath alike ſtrength in it to comfort us in the toile ſomeneſſe of our labours. <hi>As there is no temptation hath taken hold of us, but that which is common to man,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13. So there is no labour laid upon any of us in our lawfull callings, but that which is common to man. Even the Saints, whom Chriſt hath made free and ſeparated from the world, are not freed from ſervice, while they are in the world. And while Chriſt would not have them carefull in any thing, he would have them induſtrious in every thing. That Canon of the Apoſtle is clear for it, (1 Cor. 7. 20.) <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling, wherein he was called;</hi> that is, your ſpirituall calling doth not void your civill. When you have learned to drive a trade for heaven, you muſt ſtill drive your trade on earth. <hi>While there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of ſin in us, there muſt be ſomewhat of the hireling in us.</hi> There is not the moſt ingenious, no, nor the moſt ſpirituall labour, we goe about, but there is ſomewhat of the hireling in it; in the duty of prayer, in the duty of preaching, there is ſomewhat of the hireling, that is, there is bodily paine and wearineſſe, a waſte up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſtrength, and expence of our ſpirits. Though in theſe things the Saints worke not for wages, but their very works is their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and their labour their reward, though there be nothing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary in their ſpirits, yet they feel the effects of a mercenary worke, upon their bodies, even wearineſſe and waſte of naturall ſtrength and ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Seeing the daies of a man are as the daies of an hireling.</hi> Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a reward or wages, ſomewhat followes the labour and travell</hi>
                     <pb n="576" facs="tcp:40455:295"/> 
                     <hi>of this life.</hi> The hireling labours all day, but at night he hath his reward, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. Chriſt compares beleevers, even, in their ſpirituall capacity, unto labourers in a vineyard, to hirelings, who wrought for a penny a day, and at night, they had every one their pay: It is ſo in reference to the whole courſe of this life, we are hirelings; in the evening, we ſhall have our penny, verily, <hi>There is a reward for the righteous, their labour is not in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. And as the righteous have a reward, ſo, the wicked ſhall have wages. Satans hirelings ſhall have full pay, though no content, for all their works, <hi>The wages of ſin is death;</hi> there's pay, ſuch as it is, woefull pay, a black penny. The daies of man are as the daies of an hireling, there is an iſſue &amp; a reward for every work</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, note from the Metaphor, while an hireling is doing his maſters work, he doth his owne too, that is, his owne profit comes in by thoſe acts, in which he labours for another. It is thus alſo in the generall ſtate of man: above all, Chriſts ſervants and hirelings, gaine by the duties of obedience they performe to Chriſt, their own profit comes in, with his honour. A godly man cannot doe a ſtroake of worke for God, but he works for himſelf too; the ſervants of God muſt not be ſelf-ſeekers and ſelf-workers, they may not make themſelves their end; but as it is with an hireling, let him be never ſo upright hearted toward the maſter he ſerves, let him lay <hi>ſelf by,</hi> in all he doth, yet he hath a ſhare of profit in all his labors God hath ſo eſpouſed and married his owne glory, and the good of man together, that, whoſoever really promotes the one, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes both. It is ſo likewiſe with thoſe, who work the works of darkneſſe, and doe the luſts of the devill. While his ſlaves are doing his worke, they are gaining towards deſtruction, and their owne wages encreaſes daily, they are treaſuring up wrath and judgement againſt the day of wrath. As the meaſure of their ſinne fils, ſo doth the meaſure of their puniſhment. Thus alſo <hi>the daies of man, are as the daies of an hireling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two generall obſervations, which I ſhall but name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will occurre again.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The life of man, it is ſhort; As the daies of an hireling.</hi> The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant doth not abide in the houſ for ever, a hireling is but for a time. And it is good for a man; that it is ſo. ſome complaine exceeding much, becauſe their lives are ſo exceeding little. But let them weigh it well, and they ſhall ſee cauſe to rejoyce much, becauſe they live ſo little. In ſome reſpect it is good for wicked men, that their lives are
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:40455:295"/> ſo ſhort: if their lives were longer, they would be wickeder, and ſo heaping up more ſin, they would heap up more wrath againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And it is very well for the Saints, that their lives are ſo ſhort. Their corruptions &amp; temptations, their weakneſſes and infirmities, their troubles and afflictions are ſo many, that it is well their dayes are ſo few. If they ſhould have length of life added to heaps of ſorrows, and perpetuity with outward miſery, how miſerable were they! Chriſt promiſes it, as a point of favour to his, that the days of trouble ſhould be ſhortned, <hi>Except thoſe dayes ſhould be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, no fleſh ſhould be ſaved</hi> (that is, kept or preſerved alive in thoſe tribulations) <hi>but for the Elects ſakes thoſe dayes ſhall be ſhortned,</hi> Mat. 24. 22. It is a favour alſo to the Saints, that their particular dayes are ſhortned, that their's are but as the dayes of an hireling, for as much as their preſent dayes are dayes of trouble and travel. <hi>The dayes of the beſt are ſo full of evil, that it is good, they are no fuller of dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further, it is good they are ſo evil, or full of trouble. It is well for wicked men, that their dayes are full of trouble; the ſweeter their lives are to them, the ſinfuller they are againſt God. Their outward comforts are but fewel and incouragement to their luſts; and while their lives are calm and quiet, they do but ſaile more quietly down into that dead ſea of everlaſting miſery. And the Saints have this advantage by the troubleſomeneſſe of their lives, to be kept in continual exerciſe, and more dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God; they would love the world too well, and delight in the creature too much, if God did not put bitterneſſe into their cup.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having thus ſhadowed the ſtate of man, ſeems to make out his intendment or ſcope thus. <hi>There is no reaſon why I ſhould be charged ſo deeply for deſiring death; For what is the life of man? Is it not a life full of travel, and of trouble, full of dangers and temptations, is not the time of his life ſhort and ſet? Is it not a ſpeedy paſsing time, and yet a firmly appointed time? Why then ſhould not I think the period of my life to be at hand? Why ſhould not I think my appointed time is come; Foraſmuch as I have ſo many evidences and ſymptoms of death before me, and have heard ſo many meſſages and ſummons to the grave. Death ſits upon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Plurima mortis imago.</note> 
                     <hi>my lips, ready to come in, while I am ſpeaking. Death hath taken poſſeſsion of me already, and ſeiz'd my port: death is in my face, I am the very picture of death, and images of death ſtand round</hi>
                     <pb n="580" facs="tcp:40455:296"/> 
                     <hi>about me. Therefore</hi> Eliphaz, <hi>why ſhould I not call to have my daies ſummed up, that I may ſee the end and ſumme of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; Or wherefore wouldeſt thou ſtay my complaint againſt my life, or ſtop my deſire of death, by giving me hopes of many daies, and of a flouriſhing estate in this world?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>So that in theſe words, <hi>As a ſervant earneſtly deſireth the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, Job</hi> means that, which is moſt refreſhing and deſirable by a ſervant: And in thoſe Eaſtern hot Countries, ſhadows were very refreſhing and much deſired. <hi>Jacob</hi> reporting his labours in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Labans</hi> ſheep, ſaith, <hi>In the day time I was conſumed with heat, or parched with heat.</hi> Therefore a ſervant hath reaſon to deſire the ſhadow.</p>
                  <q>And as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work.</q>
                  <p>There are two things, which a ſervant or an hireling deſires much, <hi>Reſt and reward; Shadow</hi> and <hi>pay.</hi> When he is hot the ſhadow refreſhes him. And when he is hungry, his pay refreſhes him: while his hand is at work in the day, his heart is upon the wages he ſhall receive at night. Hence the Lord in compaſſion to ſervants made a gracious proviſion for them by a law, Deut. 24. 14, 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſs a hired ſervant, &amp;c. at his day thou ſhalt give him his hire, neither ſhall the Sun go down upon it, for he is poor and ſetteth his heart upon it, leſt he cry againſt thee to the Lord, and it be ſin unto thee.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> puts the inſtance in both, <hi>As the hireling looks for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his work,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <q>For the reward of his work.</q>
                  <p>So we tranſlate it. The Hebrew is, <hi>He looks for his work:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>
                     </note> Why? he had work before, he had his work all day long, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhewed him his work, he needed not look for that; then his work is the reward of his work. In the Scripture, the word <hi>work</hi> ſignifies three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The very act of labour.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="582" facs="tcp:40455:297"/> 2. The effect of labour, the thing wrought, or that which is the product of labour. When a man hath laboured, what he labour'd about is viſible, and that we call his work, as well as the act of his labour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The reward or the wages, which a man receives for his labour, Levit. 19. 13. we read a plain text for it, <hi>The wages of him that is hired, ſhall not abide with thee all night, until the morning.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>The work of him that is hired ſhal not abide with thee.</hi> So Pſal. 109. 20. <hi>Let this be the reward of mine adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obus eſt fructus ſeu merces obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris quae pro labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re datur, ber Metonymiam</note> 
                     <hi>from the Lord;</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>Let this be the work of mine adverſaries from the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 13. we have the word in the ſame ſence, work for wages. As it is uſual to put prayer for the thing prayed for, a petition for the thing petitioned, or for the thing obtained by petition, <hi>The Lord hath given me my peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. 1. 27.) that is, the child for whom I did petition. It is uſual alſo in Scripture to put ſin for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment or reward of ſin, Gen. 4. 13. <hi>My ſin is greater,</hi> that is, my puniſhment is greater, <hi>than I can bear.</hi> And the Maſter is forbidden to detain the ſervants wages, <hi>leaſt it be ſin to him,</hi> Deut. 24. 15. that is, leaſt he be puniſhed for detaining it. Thus alſo it is uſual to put the work for the reward of the work, <hi>The hireling expects his work,</hi> that is, he earneſtly looks that he ſhall have wages in the evening for his work. Now (ſaith <hi>Job)</hi> as theſe wait, the ſervant and the hireling, for the ſhadow in the day, and for their wages at night; So <hi>I am made to poſſeſſe months of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall note a point or two in paſſage from the words, as they contain a general truth, before I examine them in this applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Take the words as they are a direct propoſition, <hi>A ſervant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the ſhadow, and an hireling looks for the reward of his work.</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The condition of a ſervant is a very laborious and a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome condition;</hi> He longs for ſome reſt; he earneſtly deſires the ſhadow. Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſervant muſt have a reward.</hi> Ther's all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world he ſhould. Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The hireling hath earneſt thoughts upon his reward;</hi> His reward is in his eye. It is the reaſon given, why the wages of the hired ſervant ſhould not be with-held, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 15. The Lord
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:40455:297"/> the righteous judge between Maſters and ſervants, gives this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or ground of his Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not detaine his wages, for he ſetteth his heart upon it;</hi> Poor man, he hath been working all day, and he hath had his heart upon his wages; the hopes of that, gave him ſome relief and eaſe in going through his hard task and ſervice, therfore thou ſhalt not keep it from him, his heart is ſet upon it.</p>
                  <p>But it may be queſtioned; Is not this a ſin in the ſervant, to ſet his heart upon his wages? A charge is given, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 10. <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not your heart upon them;</hi> and is it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable in a ſervant, to ſet his heart upon his wages or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe?</p>
                  <p>There is a great difference (and it is worthy our notice) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two Scriptures. The word in <hi>Deutronomy</hi> (ſpeaking of the poor ſervant) notes the lifting up of the ſoul; <hi>He hath lifted up his ſoul unto it,</hi> ſo we read in the margin of our Bibles: But in the <hi>Pſame</hi> (where he ſpeaks of the covetous rich man) the word imports, the letting down, or ſetling of his heart upon it. A poor man hath but a little, and his wages (it may be) is above him, his wages (poſſibly) is more than he is worth, therefore he lifteth up his mind to it, as a mercy and a bleſſing from God, for the relief of himſelf and family; take heed (ſaith the Lord) that thou detain not his wages; for the poor man lifteth up his ſoul to it, as a thing he reacheth upward for; <hi>It is very dangerous to take that out of the hands of man, which he is taking (as it were) out of the hand of God.</hi> But a rich man, who hath aboundance, lets his heart down, he croucheth and broodeth upon the creature. A godly poor man, looks up to his reward, and fetches his bread from Heaven; A covetous rich man looks down to his reward, and takes his bread from the earth; A godly man is above all earthly things, and yet he lifts up his mind to receive them. A meer natural man is below earthly things, and yet he deſcends that he may receive them: The things which both receive, are the ſame, but the conveyance and derivation, differ alwayes, as much as Heaven and earth, ſometimes, as much as Heaven and hell. But to the text. Laſtly obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That, it is the property of an hireling</hi> (take it ſtrictly) <hi>to eye his reward.</hi> This is the deſcription of an hireling, <hi>he is one who looks to his reward, whatſoever be doth to his work.</hi> Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 10. 13. confirms this character, <hi>The hireling fleeth, becauſe he</hi>
                     <pb n="584" facs="tcp:40455:298"/> 
                     <hi>is an hireling, and careth not for the ſheep;</hi> he cares much for the fleece, and for the fleſh, but he cares little, if at all for the ſheep, that is, how, or whether the ſheep be fed and proſper. He that works for Chriſt, finds his reward in his work, and his eye is upon his work, as a reward, as well as upon the reward of his work: he is pleaſed as much, yea far more with his buſineſs, then he is with his wages: Did he not take content, and pay himſelf in this, that he is in a work acceptable to Chriſt, he could take no content, he could not be pleaſed at all, that he is in a work profitable to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Job</hi> applies this general, about the nature of a ſervant and an hireling, to his own condition. <hi>So I am made to poſſeſs months of vanity, and weariſome nights are appointed to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So am I made.</hi> It looks like a ſtrange, and a very unlikely ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; <hi>As a ſervant deſireth the ſhadow, ſo am I made to poſſeſs months of vanity:</hi> Therefore to clear it, we muſt remember, that this is a ſimilitude with a diſſimilitude: The ſimilitude is conceald, the diſſimilitude is expreſt; we may make it out thus; <hi>As a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant deſireth the ſhadow, and an hireling looketh for the reward</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Similitudo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilis.</note> 
                     <hi>of his work, ſo I, who am labouring in the heat of theſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, do earneſtly deſire a ſhadow, and I who am at work, as an hireling, would have a reward; that is, I would ſee the end and iſſue of theſe troubles; But</hi> (here's the diſſimilitude) <hi>I am made to poſſeſſe months of vanity, and weariſome nights are appointed to me;</hi> As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>When the ſervant hath wrought all day, and is weary he can lie down at night quietly &amp; reſt himſelf; but alas! the night is as troubleſome, and as laborious to me as the day; When the hireling hath laboured and taken pains, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his reward at evening, but my wages are months of vanity, and my rewards are nights of trouble, I am paid in ill coyne, months of vanity, weariſome nights are appointed for the reward of weary dayes.</hi> Thus the ſence is plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am made to poſſeſs.]</hi> The word ſignifies poſſeſſing by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance and deſcent. Two things are implied in that phraſe: <note place="margin">

Such months have I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to me.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay: <hi>Months of vanity:</hi> Why doth <hi>Job</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of this? Hath any man in the world any other than months of vanity? Why then doth <hi>Job</hi> take it ſo ill, that he poſſeſſeth months of vanity, when no other fall to the lot or poſſeſſion of any man? <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 39. verſ. 5. affirms, <hi>that, man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity;</hi> What reaſon then hath <hi>Job</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of months of vanity in his worſt eſtate? It was with him as well as with any of his neighbours, we know not who hath any other than months of vanity. The Preacher makes this the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his Sermon, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Vanity of vanities (ſaith the Preacher) vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, it is true, our whole life is a life of vanity, but yet there is more vanity in ſome mans life, or in ſome part of the ſame mans life, than in another. Vanity is gradual. There is a vain, and a rainer vanity, and there is the vaineſt vanity. Months of vanity may be underſtood two waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Months of vanity,</hi> that is, months empty of comfort, fruitleſſe months, months bringing me no refreſhing or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <note place="margin">Inanis &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cua, quia erat vacua hominibus jumentis &amp; plantis.</note> As <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. it is ſaid, <hi>the earth was without form and void: void,</hi> that is, it had neither man, nor beaſt, nor plant upon it, there was nothing but emptineſſe upon the face of the earth, as it lay in that rude maſſe; So <hi>Job</hi> ſaith here, mine are months of vanity, void months, that is, months not filled up with any comfort, with any refreſhing, with any joy, with any light or content, all theſe which are as the filling up of our months, and the beauty of time, are taken away from me, mine are empty months, my dayes are all Dogg-dayes, or at beſt, the dayes in the kalender of my life are blanks.</p>

So the word is uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 33. where the Pſalmiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the ſinful diſtempers of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Gods anger towards them, <hi>They beleeved not his word, &amp;c.</hi> What then? <hi>Therefore their dayes did he conſume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</hi> The dayes of all men are conſumed in vanity, as we ſaid before? but here was ſomewhat more judicial and poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; It is a ſore judgment to conſume our dayes in vanity, as that people did: As ſoon as they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were in a fair way to <hi>Canaan;</hi> but God leads them about by the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and there lets them wander out forty years, expecting and waiting for <hi>Canaan,</hi> but no <hi>Canaan</hi> came, or they came not to <hi>Canaan;</hi> this was the <hi>ſpending of their yeares in vanity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were travelling to their deſired reſt, but enjoyed it not; they went toyling up and down the wilderneſſe as in a maze, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way out, but at the door of the grave; their carkaſſes fell in the wilderneſſe; thus their dayes were conſumed in vanity. So ſaith <hi>Job, I poſſeſs months of vanity,</hi> that is, months wherein I am tired out in continual troubles, and they are fruitleſſe, iſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe troubles, I have no ſenſible benefit by them, I ſee no end of them, my hopes are fruſtrate, and put far off from me.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Troubles will prevail upon us, whether we will or no. I am made to poſſeſs, &amp;c.</hi> As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, I would fain have got over theſe months of vanity, or worn them out, but whether I will or no, I am made to poſſeſſe them. <hi>The bands of affliction, are too ſtrong for the creature to break:</hi> when the Lord ſends trouble, he will make a man poſſeſſe it, how diſpleaſing ſoever it is; <hi>It is beſt for us to ſubmit, where we cannot remedy, and to yeeld quietly to that, which we cannot avoid.</hi> Secondly, Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Troubles come to us, as our natural inheritance. I am made to poſſeſs months of vanity,</hi> they are as mine inheritance, and I would wave my right, but I cannot.

The common condition of all men, in their beſt eſtate is, <hi>that they are altogether vanity,</hi> but the vanity of ſome men is more vaine, their afflictions more afflicting, their troubles more troubleſome, and their ſickneſſe more ſick than their brethren. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes as if he had ſpoil'd all the world of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and had engroſs'd all vanity to himſelf: <hi>I am made to poſſeſſe moneths of vanity:</hi> That vanity which is the portion of all men, ſeemes ſometimes to be the portion of one man alone. <hi>I am the man that hath ſeen affliction,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jeremie.</hi>

The word is ſo taken here, to note a ſpeciall end to which theſe nights, being ſubſtracted from the reſt of his time, were appointed; namely, they were to be as <hi>Jobs pay and reward;</hi> He was troubled all day, and if he looked for his reward or comfort in the evening, this was given him, <hi>A night as weariſome as his day,</hi> or he had an ill nights reſt given for his hard dayes labour. The Prophet gives us the word in ſuch a ſence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 11, 12. He tels the <hi>Jewes</hi> their ſin in the former words, <hi>Ye furniſh a drink offering to that number;</hi> Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his meaning to be, a reproofe of that wicked and ſuperſtitious cuſtome, wherein the <hi>Jewes</hi> (it ſeems) did ſympolize with the heathens, who were wont to drink to their <hi>Idols by number,</hi> to ſuch an <hi>Idol</hi> they would drink ſo many cups, and that was called a <hi>drink offering to that number;</hi> Now ſaith God, becauſe you have done thus, namely, <hi>furniſhed a drink offering to that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, therefore I will number you to the ſword,</hi> or, therefore I will appoint you to the ſword, I will ſubſtract and take you out, and you ſhall be the men ſeparated for the ſword to deal with and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy; I will number you to the ſword, that ſhall drink your bloud, becauſe you have been ſo accurate in wickedneſſe, to drink by number. The word is applied to Chriſt <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 53. 12.) <hi>He was numbred amongſt the tranſgreſſors,</hi> that is, he was taken aſide, and ſeparated from the innocent, and ranked amongſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; which notes him appointed, or ſet apart to that end, that ſo he might be the Saviour of tranſgreſſors, and a deliverer of the wicked from their ſins.

                     <hi>of meat he hath numbred out to you, ſo many flagons of wine,</hi> he hath ſubſtracted ſuch a proportion, and appointed it to you, and I dare not alter it. And in the Propheſie of <hi>Jonah, chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. it is ſaid, <hi>God prepared a great fiſh to ſwallow up Jonah,</hi> ſo we tranſlate, the Hebrew is, <hi>God numbred a great fiſh to ſwallow up Jonah,</hi> that is, God did ſeparate or ſubſtanct a fiſh from all the reſt of the fiſhes of the ſea, for that end and purpoſe, to ſwallow up <hi>Ionah.</hi> From all which inſtances it is clear, that the word notes an appointment, by way of deſign, or the drawing of a thing to ſome ſpeciall uſe and ſervice. When <hi>a Party</hi> is drawn out of the body of an Army, they are numbred or appointed to ſome deſign; ſuch a meaning is in <hi>Iobs</hi> words, theſe nights are ſubſtracted or drawn out, and then appointed to be my reward and wages. The ſumme of all is, <hi>Iob</hi> comparing his eſtate with that of hirelings, ſervants and ſouldiers, finds his far worſe than theirs, they have reſt in the night, at leaſt ſome nights they reſt, but he had none.</p>

                  <p>As a man ſin-ſick, before he comes to reſt and healing in Chriſt, toſſes from place to place, from this duty to that duty, from this meanes to that meanes to get a little eaſe for his wounded ſpirit and aking conſcience; he hopeth this will do him good, and that will doe him good, but all in vaine. And as worldly men hope their pleaſures and their riches will do them good, and ſo they toſſe from one pleaſure to another, from creture to creature, but al fails there is no ſettlement, no compoſedneſſe, no peace, no redreſſe, till the ſoul fixes upon Chriſt. So in bodily paines, there is no eaſe, no refreſhing, but in God: it is not this or that place of the bed, it is not the bed or the couch, it is not the Country or the City, a ſharp or a temperate aire can do it; God can alone, and he can command any creature to do it.</p>

                  <q>Is clothed with worms.</q>
                  <p>In the firſt Chapter of this booke at the 21. verſe, <hi>Iob</hi> deſcribes himſelf thus, <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall I return;</hi> but now it ſeemes <hi>Iob</hi> hath got clothing, and being ready to lie downe in the grave, he had a veſture put upon him, now (it ſeemes) <hi>Iob</hi> ſhould not goe naked out of the world, for he ſaid, <hi>My fleſh is clothed;</hi> but, what is this clothing? <hi>My fleſh is clothed with worms, and clods of duſt,</hi> that's a ſuite of clothes very fit and ſutable for the grave, but it is uſually put on in the grave. <hi>Iob</hi> is in his grave-clothes before he dies; or, he ſpeakes this to ſhew that he accounted himſelf dead, while he lived, or (as <hi>Heman</hi> mourns, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 88.) <hi>Free among the dead;</hi> A member of that Corporation, a brother of that ſociety already. For he was now in their habet or livery, <hi>A gown of worms ſet or embroidered with clods of duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>My fleſh is clothed with wormes.</q>
                  <p>It is frequent in Scripture, when the holy Ghoſt would heighten the ſenſe of what we are, &amp; enjoy, would to note the abundance of <note place="margin">Quavis re ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiri dicimur, Cujus acceſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vel dedeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramur, vel oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namur.</note> a thing, or how man is adorned, or defiled with it all over, then to expreſſe it under the notion of cloathing; God himſelf is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, <hi>cloathed with Majeſty,</hi> becauſe he is Majeſtie all over, and there is nothing but glory upon him; God is alſo deſcribed, clothed with judgement and with juſtice; why? Becauſe theſe are his honour and his ornament, he is juſtice and judgement all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; we find <hi>Job</hi> in the 29. of this book at the 14, verſe, ſpeaking thus of himſelf in his ſtate of Magiſtracy, <hi>I put on righteouſneſſe, and it clothed me, my judgement was as a robe and a diademe;</hi> that is, I was full of righteouſneſſe, I was altogether reghteous, in diſpenſing re wards and puniſhments, in exerciſing my power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:40455:303"/> the people. To be cloathed with humility, to be cloathed with the Spirit, to be clothed with Chriſt, are phraſes of the ſame importance. So on the other hand to be cloathed with pride, with ſhame, with diſhonour, <hi>Let mine enemies</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) be cloathed with ſhame,</hi> Pſal. 109. 29. <hi>Let them be cloathed with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,</hi> Pſal. 35. 26. that is, let them be aſhamed and diſhonour'd, all over, or exceedingly aſhamed or diſhonoured. And ſo a great deſolation is called a cloathing with deſolation, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 7. 27. <hi>That which ſtripps a man naked is in this ſence called his cloathing,</hi> cloathed with deſolation.</p>
                  <p>Thus we are to underſtand <hi>Job,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>That his fleſh was cloathed with wormes;</hi> his meaning is, he had many wormes, crawling upon his fleſh, or lying within his fleſh, and ſo were as a lining to his upper garment of nature. Theſe worms ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all over him, as a filthy and loathſome garment covering his whole body.</p>
                  <p>And beſides this figure, <hi>Job</hi> ſpake properly, while he was thus full of ſores, and botches, and boyles, to ſay, he was cloathed with wormes; wormes are proper to ſores, many ſores, breed wormes, and wormes are a diſeaſe in the fleſh, as well as within the bowels, and ſuch diſeaſes are accounted the fouleſt and filthieſt diſeaſes of all other: Such was <hi>Jobs,</hi> his ſores and boiles corrupted and bred wormes, which made him an abhorring to himſelf, <hi>Putrifaction is the foyle out of which worms grow,</hi> Rotten fleſh breeds wormes, and a rotten conſcience breeds a worm, Iſa. 66. 24. <hi>Their worme ſhall not die;</hi> why doth the holy Ghoſt ſay of thoſe men who were never waſhed, nor healed of their ſinne-ſores, of their ſoul-ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and pollutions, that when they die, they have a worme, that dieth not. It is in alluſion to this, becauſe, as a corrupt body, or corrupt putrid fleſh, breeds noiſome wormes, ſo a corrupt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a ſoule full of filthineſſe and uncleanneſſe, which was never waſhed or healed in the fountain of the bloud of Chriſt, this ſoul, this conſcience breeds wormes, even that gnawing worme, which ſhall live with it, feed upon it, and cloath it for ever. Both the naturall and the ſpirituall worme, ariſe from rottenneſſe, and derive their pedigree from ſores, ſickneſſes, and putrifaction.</p>
                  <q>And clods of duſt.</q>
                  <p>

                     </note> the word ſignifies the filings of any mettall, or the ſcrapings of an uncleane thing. It is ſaid expreſſely in the ſecond Chapter, that <hi>he tooke a pot-ſherd to ſcrape himſelf;</hi> thoſe clods of filthy duſt, or ſcales ſcrap'd from his putrifying ſores; theſe, with the crawling wormes bred in them, cover'd his whole body like a garment, and therefore he complaines, <hi>I am cloathed with worms and clods of duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee what his garment was, ſee now (to carry on the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) his skin, upon which this garment was put? <hi>My skin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is broken, and become loathſome.</hi> The skin is the immediate garment of the fleſh, his ſickneſſe had worne out his skin, he had many holes and rents in that garment, which needed mending, and it was all over ſo filthy, that it needed waſhing. <hi>My fleſh is broken and become loathſome.</hi> Sores breake the skin, and defile the skin, <hi>Jobs</hi> skin was ſo broken and chapt, ſo defiled and filthy, that he was loathſome to all beholders, and to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This is the picture of <hi>Job,</hi> A few daies before, you might have pictured or drawn him thus, Job <hi>cloathed with ſilk and ſcarlet, his garment ſet with precious orientall ſtones, his skin ſmooth and beautifull, his face cheerfull and manly, his eye quick and piercing. But now</hi> Job <hi>is cloathed with worms and clods of duſt, his skin is broken and become loathſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may hence learne, what our own bodies are. The Apoſtle <hi>(Phil.</hi> 3. 21.) cals the body, <hi>a vile body;</hi> not that the worke of God was vile: The worke of God was noble and honourable in all he wrought, eſpecially in that Maſter-peece of it, the fabrique of mans body; but as the body is come out of the hands of ſinne, ſo it is a vile body, that is, it is a body ſubject to corruption, and will quickly corrupt, be vile and loathſome, 1 Cor. 15 53. <hi>This corruptable muſt put on incorruption.</hi> The body of man is but one remove from wormes and corruption, Chap. 17. 4. <hi>I have ſaid to corruption thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t my Father, and to the worme, thou art my mother.</hi> We ſhall quickly bear the image of our parents, wormes and corruption.</p>
                  <p>Then be not proud of your bodies, nor of your beauties; They, who are now the faireſt and goodlieſt to looke upon, may quickly have a broken and a loathſome skin; A diſeaſe, one fit of ſickneſſe will ſpoile all thy beauty, deface and blemiſh thy excellent feature,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:40455:304"/> and if a diſeaſe doth it not, old-age will, time will draw furrows in thy face, and make wrinkles in thy brow. Strength and beauty of body are no matches for time. All things were made in <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>time</hi> will marr all things. So long as generation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, corruption muſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, take heed of pride in cloathing. The two externals, of which man is moſt ſubject to be proud, are beauty and apparell. Cloaths are a flag of vanity, and pride ſits upon the skirts. But remember how fine ſoever your cloathing is this day and houre, God can put you on another ſuite before to morrow. We ſee what change of apparrell <hi>Iob</hi> had, a godly man, an humble man. That which God did to try the grace of one; he can quickly do to puniſh and chaſtiſe the ſin of another; he can quickly put you on ſuch clothing, as you ſhall have little cauſe to be proud of. <hi>He can make you weare wormes and clods of duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if we conſider it, we have little reaſon to be proud of clothes: for if we follow the beſt of them to their originall, they will be found to be but a clothing of wormes, and clods of duſt; what are ſilkes, ſattins and velvets, but the iſſue of wormes? And what is your gold and ſilver, what your pearls and precious ſtones? are they any thing (if you will reſolve them into their principles) but <hi>clods of duſt?</hi> They are indeed better concocted by the heat of the Sunne, refined and poliſhed by the art of a man, but if you ſearch their pedigree, they alſo are but clods of duſt. In your moſt glorious aray, you are but cloathed with duſt and wormes, and if you be proud of ſuch cloathing, God can cloth you with <hi>worms and clods, not onely of unrefined and unpolliſhed, but of putrified and filthy duſt.</hi>

                     <hi>All time is ſhort, and we have a very ſhort eſtate in time. Man is not maſter of one day, and a ſervant but of few dayes.</hi> The holy Ghoſt gives us very many remembrances of this, which is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that we are very apt to forget it. Man is ſlow to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſwiftneſſe of time, and very dull in apprehending the ſpeed of his dayes. It is a wonder that ſuch a plaine common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſhould be handled ſo often, and that the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould as it were, labour for ſimilitudes, and fetch in all things that are more then ordinarily tranſitory in nature, to teach us the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſſe of our condition: We meete with many in this booke, all hinting at the ſudden, inviſible motion of time: This is a point eaſie to be known, but very hard to be beleeved; every man aſſents to it, but few live it. And ſurely the holy Ghoſt would not ſpend ſo many words about it, nor gather up ſo many illuſtrations of it from ſence, if it were not of much importance to our faith. We uſually ſlight the hearing of common principles; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd a Sermon preacht upon this ſubject, the ſhortneſſe of our lives, and the ſpeed of time, is judg'd a needleſſe ſhortning of time; and the houre ſeemes very long, which runs out upon the ſpeed of time; we think it an eaſie doctrine, and a Theame for boyes. But the truth is, if the heart did well diſgeſt, how few our dayes are, we ſhould have better dayes; and men would live holier, if they
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:40455:306"/> knew indeed their lives were no longer. Therefore though I only touch this ſubject, yet, doe ye dwell upon it, and ſtay long in your thoughts upon the ſhortneſſe of your lives: <hi>Common truths neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, cauſe a neglect of every truth.</hi> Had we more ſerious thoughts of Heaven and hell, that theſe are, and what theſe are; that there is a God, and who he is; that there will be a judgement, and what it will be, we ſhould more profitably improve and trade our time and talents.

                     <hi>Time paſſeth irrecoverably.</hi> When the weavers ſhuttle is once out of his hand, 'tis gone preſently; there is no hope time paſt ſhould be recalled, or time in motion ſtopt: To conſider time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion, ſhould make us very good husbands of our time, or (as the Apoſtle adviſes) <hi>to redeeme the time.</hi> Redemptions are made by purchaſe, to redeem a thing, is to buy it with a price; the price we redeeme time with, is our labourand faithfull travell. <hi>It is matter of mourning, to conſider, that ſo little care is taken in ſpending that, which when it is gone, we have no hope it can be reſtored to us again.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, In that <hi>Iob</hi> complained before, that his life was ſo long, and now complaineth of the ſhortneſſe or ſwiftneſſe of his life, we may note; That,</p>

                     <hi>Man thinks good daies end too ſoone, and that evill dayes ſtay too long, or will never have an end.</hi> We love the company of good dayes, and are therefore ſorry when they depart: When the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were upon the Mount, and had ſuch a good day of it, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous were they to have continued there, and ſorry they were the day was at an end. <hi>Maſter</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) it is good for us to be here: The ſudden paſſing of our comforts, is our trouble.</hi> Time is alwayes of the ſame pace, no creature keeps his pace more evenly then time doth, it alwayes moves at the ſame rate, neither faſter nor ſlower; but man thinks this time ſhort, and that time long; this time ſpeedy, and that time ſlow, according to the ſeverall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects he meets with, and to the conditions wherein he is: Fourthly obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That hope is the laſt refuge of the ſoule: My dayes are ſpent without hope,</hi> my hope is ſpent too; If I had hope left, I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what left, but my hope is gone. It is ſo in naturall things, it is ſo in ſpirituall things. The Apoſtle, <hi>Heb</hi> 6. tells us, that hope <hi>is the anchor of the ſoule, ſure and ſtedfaſt;</hi> while hope holds, comfort holds, and when hope's gone, all's gone. Obſerve laſtly,</p>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>That, ſometimes a godly mans hope may lye proſtrate. My dayes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are cut off without hope: Job</hi> thought (as I have noted from ſome paſſages before (that his caſe was deſperate, his hope lay in the duſt, as well as his body, or his honour. Every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is not an <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>That againſt hope he beleeved in hope:</hi> Nay <hi>Abraham</hi> is not alwayes <hi>Abraham,</hi> he that hath ſuch a ſtrong hope, hath it not alwayes, even his hope may ſometimes poſſibly be hopeleſſe. There are weakeneſſes in the ſtrongeſt, and imperfections may come upon thoſe who are perfect, ebbings after the greateſt flowings, and declinings after the greateſt heights of graces and gracious actings <hi>My dayes are ſpent without hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having thus complained of his condition, and aſſerted his own deſires of death, now turnes from his friends, with whom he had diſcourſed all this while, and betakes himſelf to God, to ſpeake a while with him; The next words are generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>an Apoſtrophe to God:</hi>

                  <q>Verſe 7. <hi>Or member that my life is wind, mine eye ſhall no more ſee good, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O remember that my life is wind.</hi> To remember, is not here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſtrictly, for to God all things are preſent. Remembrance, is the calling of that to mind which is paſt; when the act of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring is applied to God in Scriprure, it hath one of theſe three ſences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It notes a reſolution or ſetled purpoſe in God, to act his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or inflict puniſhment upon his enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 7. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, O Lord, the children of Edom:</hi> that is, Lord bring forth that decree of thine, for the ruine and deſtruction of theſe bloudy <hi>Edomites,</hi> who have been cruell againſt thy people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it ſignifies an affection in God, ready to help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve his own people: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 2. <hi>Remember thy Congregation which thou didſt purchaſe of old,</hi> that is, doe good to thy Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, bleſſe thy Congregation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>To remember,</hi> imports an act of preſent conſideration: to remember, is fully to weigh, obſerve and take notice of the eſtate of things or perſons: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 39. <hi>He remembred that they were but fleſh, a wind that paſſeth away and cometh not againe;</hi> that is, he conſider'd and weighed the eſtate of man: So in this place, <hi>O remember that my life is wind,</hi> that is, conſider, and weigh it
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:40455:307"/> well Lord, put my condition into the ballance, obſerve what a weak creature I am, how ſhort my llfe is: therefore deal with me, as with a weak ſhort-lived creature; Thou needeſt not lay any great ſtreſſe upon me, thou needeſt not trouble thy ſelf much to make an end of me, my life is but wind, 'tis but a puffe, which quickly paſſes away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O remember that my life is wind.</hi> This is a proverbial ſpeech, <note place="margin">Vita ventus, Elegans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbiale.</note> like that before, of <hi>a weavers ſhuttle.</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>wind,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>holy Ghoſt, the third Perſon in the bleſſed Trinity:</hi> As alſo a Spirit in general. And becauſe the wind is of a ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, inviſible, ſwift, powerful, therefore it is applied to that aerial or elementary ſpirit; And the operation of the holy Ghoſt, is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by wind or breath, <hi>Chriſt breathed upon his Diſciples ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, receive the holy Ghoſt, John</hi> 20. 22. and the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> came <hi>as a mighty ruſhing wind,</hi> Acts 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>remember that my life is wind,</hi> he means, <hi>my</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Quaſi ventus Targum.</note> 
                     <hi>life is like the wind;</hi> It is a ſimilitude; not an aſſertion. The life of man is like the wind in two things: Firſt, the wind paſſeth away ſpeedily, ſo doth mans life: Secondly, the wind when it is paſt, returns no more, as you cannot ſtop the wind, or change its courſe; So all the power in the world, is not powerful enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callor divert the wind, which way the wind goes it will goe, and when it goes 'tis gone, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. 34. <hi>He remembred that they were but fleſh, wind that paſſeth away;</hi> in this ſence <hi>Job</hi> calleth his life a wind, it paſſeth away, and ſhall not return, by any law or conſtitution of nature, or by any efficacy of natural cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Yet here obſerve, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith not, <hi>His ſoul was a wind,</hi> but <hi>his life was a wind.</hi> Some have <hi>philoſophiz'd</hi> the ſoul into a wind, a blaſt or a breath; and tell us, that it goes, as the ſoul of a beaſt, that life and ſoul are but the ſame thing, when the life's gone out of the body, the ſoule's gone from its being: They acknowledg a reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it again with the body at the reſurrection, but deny it any exiſtence when ſeparate from the body. How diſhonourable this is to the noble conſtitution of man, and how diſſonant to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is proved in mentioning it; we acknowledge, that life which is the union of ſoul and body, is a wind and paſſeth away; In all the learned languages, <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latine,</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Solomen,</hi> Eccl. 3. 19, 20, 21. brings in the Atheiſt, drawing this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from thoſe confuſed oppreſſions which he obſerved in the world: men carried themſelves ſo like beaſts, preying upon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring one another, that he (who had nothing but carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to judge by) preſently reſolves; <hi>That which befalleth the ſons of men, befalleth beaſts, even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, ſo dieth the other, yea they have all one breath; ſo that a man hath no preeminence above a beaſt, for all are vanity; all goe to one place, all are of the duſt, and all turn to the duſt again.</hi> And whereas the Atheiſt heard ſome ſpeake of the aſcent of mans ſpirit after this life, he puts it off, as but talke and gueſſing. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Who knoweth the ſpirit of man, that goeth upward, and the ſpirit of the beaſt, that goeth downward to the earth?</hi> That is, who can tell that there is ſuch a difference, between the ſpirit of a man and of a beaſt? who ever ſaw the one aſcending, or the other deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? or from what Anatomie was this learned?

The Preacher in this Book, perſonated thoſe whom he abhor'd, and ſometimes ſpeakes the practiſes of other men, not his own opinion.

                     <hi>Mine eye ſhall not ſee good.</hi> What good? when a man dies, ſhall he ſee no more good? we ſee but little good while we live, and the greateſt good, is to be ſeen when we die: or rather while we live, what doe we ſee but evill, and when the Saints die, what have they to ſee but good? how is it then, that <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>when I die, mine eye ſhall not ſee good?</hi> what miſerable creatures were we, if there were no good to be ſeen, beyond the line of this life? our richeſt ſtock of comfort, lyes in the good we ſhall ſee hereafter, which is therefore called, the <hi>bleſſed-making viſion;</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> knew well enough, that his eyes ſhould ſee good after death, for he ſaith <hi>(chap.</hi> 19. 27.) <hi>with theſe eyes ſhall I ſee God;</hi> he knew alſo his ſoule had an eye to ſee good (and a better good then ever he ſaw in the world) while his body lay in the grave. Then, his meaning of, <hi>Mine eye ſhall no more ſee good,</hi> is, no more worldly good, none of † theſe good things, which I have ſeen; I ſhall be above the ſmart of earthly ſorrows, and above the ſence of earthly joyes. Good is either natural, or civill, or ſpirituall; When God created the world, he looked upon all that he bad made, and he ſaw that all was very good: Civill good, is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, peace and proſperity of the world, death ſtops the ſight of all this good.

When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> thought he ſhould die, he deſcribes the ſtate of the dead by a deprivation of all thoſe comforts which are taken in, by the ſight of the eye. But you wil ſay, how ſaith he, <hi>I ſhal not ſee the Lord?</hi> He doth not ſay abſolutely, <hi>I ſhall not ſee the Lord?</hi> But with a modification, thus, <hi>I ſhall not ſee the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> But did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſee the Lord in the land of the living, or while he lived? Yes, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſaw him that was inviſible,</hi> ſo did <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> God makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf viſible to the Saints in this life. Though God cannot be ſeen in his eſſence in Heaven, much leſſe on earth, yet he is ſeen in his works, in the acts of his providence, and in his ordinances; we may <hi>ſee the goings of God in the Sanctuary,</hi> and behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lord, while we enquire in his Temple, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27. 4. So that when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſhall not ſee the Lord in the land of the living;</hi> his meaning is, I ſhall not behold God in his great works, and in the ordinances of his holy worſhip, and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of his holy people. In all theſe God is viſible, and moſt in the laſt; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>I ſhall behold man no more, with the inhabitants of the world;</hi> God is viſible in all creatures, but moſt in man, and among men, moſt in his Saints, and among his Saints moſt, when they meet in the comely order of his houſe and worſhip; The ignorant and unlearned coming into ſuch a ſacred throng; ſees ſo much of God, that he is convinced and goes away reporting, that God is in them of a truth. <hi>In Christ is ſeen the brightneſſe of his Fathers glory, and in the Saints much of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it is ſeen. Chriſt is the expreſs image of his perſon, and in the Saints ſo meeting, much of his image is expreſſed.</hi>

                     <hi>In our diſtreſſes it is better to cry to God, then to complaine to creatures.</hi> God is uſually the laſt, but he is alwayes the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:40455:310"/> when we have told over the ſtory of our ſorrowes and ſad condition, and powr'd our wants into the boſomes of our moſt faithfull friends; yet, this <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> is ſweeteſt to the ſoul, when we can turn unto God, <hi>O remember me.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> in his ſickneſſe, that he <hi>turned himſelf unto the wall and prayed,</hi> he turned from the people, from thoſe that were about his bed, unto the wall; why, what was the wall to him? Or what could the wall doe for him? ſurely nothing. As good turne to an Idol for helpe or eaſe, as to a wall, yea ſuch a turn to the wall, turnes the wall into an idol; Good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had no thought of the wall, nor had he any meſſage to any image, hanging there. But as 'tis probable, many of his loving Subjects and ſervants were weeping about the bed of their ſicke King, and he had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of his diſeaſe, and telling them of his ſickneſſe, <hi>but at laſt he turns to the wall;</hi> that is, he leaves ſpeaking to the company, and turnes away from them, that he might have communion with God, and his firſt word of prayer, is, the ſame with <hi>Jobs, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber now O Lord, Iſa.</hi> 38. 3. Creatures are but creatures, and when they have done their beſt for us, it may be they can doe no good for us; when they have tried all their skill, and all their ſtrength, and ſtirred the utmoſt of their abilities, to give us coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and eaſe, we muſt ſay to them all, ſtand by, and come to <hi>Iobs Turne, O Lord remember. That man is moſt to be bemoaned, who can make his moane to man only.</hi> He, who knows not how to complaine to God, or to ſpeake out his ſorrowes, and his griefes in the eare of Chriſt, ſhall gaine little, (though he receive much) by complaining to the creature. But ſo long as we have a God to turne to, and ſpread our cauſe before, though men turne from us, yea, though they turne againſt us, and forget us, yet it is enough, that we have ſaid, <hi>O Lord remember.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the matter, which <hi>Iob</hi> puts God in mind of, namely his naturall frailty and fleeting condition, that he was a <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wind.</hi> Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is an argument, moving the Lord to compaſſion, to mind him of the frailty of our condition.</hi> There is no argument from our ſelves, ſo effectuall, to draw out the bowels of Gods compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons toward us, either in regard of our ſpirituall or temporall eſtate, as this, to tell him how fraile we are; The Pſalmiſt ſhewes this the motive of mercy often to that ancient people the Jewes, Pſal. 78. 38. <hi>He being full of compaſſion forgave their iniquity, and</hi>
                     <pb n="609" facs="tcp:40455:310"/> 
                     <hi>deſtroyed them not, yea many a time turned he his anger away, and did not ſtirre up all his wrath;</hi> But what moved the Lord to deale thus with his people? What was it, out of himſelfe? We know, the inward moving cauſe was his own free-grace, but what did he look upon abroad in the creature? <hi>He remembred that they were but fleſh, A wind that paſſeth away, and commeth not againe. Jobs</hi> argument to a letter. He conſidered how eaſily and quickly they might be deſtroyed, and therefore he deſtroyed them not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 14. <hi>Like as a father pittieth his children, ſo doth the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Why, what ſtirr's up this pity? <hi>For he knoweth our frame, and he remembreth that we are but duſt;</hi> Now, that which God himſelf makes the argument, all the argument in us, of his turning to us in mercy; that we ſhould mannage, eſpecially as our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when we turn to him in prayer. Should we plead before God our perfections, and ſay, Lord remember our holineſſe, our zeale, our prayers, our teares, our faſtings and humiliations, could any of this move God, or be any attractive of his compaſſions toward us? If we will plead our perfections; God will deſpiſe our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Our ſtrongeſt argument is to ſay, we are weake, and to tell God we are ſinfull, prevailes more, then to tell him, we are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: We ſhall gaine moſt by ſaying we are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>But did not <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> entreat the Lord to <hi>remember that he had walked before him in truth and with a perfect heart, and done that which was good in his ſight?</hi> Iſa. 38. 3. And doth not <hi>Nehemiah</hi> uſe the like plea, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 14, 22.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, that, theſe were the beſt, moſt the ſpirituall and powerfull pleadings with God is not proved, becauſe uſed by good men. Grace doth not act alwaies at the height, nor bring out choiſeſt it's treaſures at all times.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they move the Lord to remember what good they had done, but they doe not move the Lord by that remembrance to doe them good. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſo far from rejoycing in his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes: that the text ſaith, <hi>He wept ſore.</hi> And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> with the ſame breath, deſires the Lord to remember what he had done, and to ſpare him, according to the greatneſſe or multitude of mercy. He, that when he hath done beſt, beggs a multitude of mercies to ſpare him, is farre enough from challenging juſtice to reward him.</p>
                  <p>Men, that are but ingenuous, will be moved moſt with a ſight or report of anothers weakneſſe. The beggar ſpeaks moſt effectually

                  <p>It is uſual in Scripture to compare thoſe things, which are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing &amp; ſuddenly conſumed, to clouds, In which ſence <hi>(Iſai.</hi> 44. 22.) the ſins of the Saints are compared to a cloud, and the pardoning of their ſins to this conſuming and ſcattering of the cloud, <hi>I have blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out as a thick cloud thy tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud thy ſins.</hi> A cloud is but a kind of a blot in the pure parchment-roll of the skies, I am ſure a cloud of ſinne is a foule blot in the roll of our lives, Blot a fair writing, and you cannot read it, but blot out the blots, and then 'tis legible again: yet, the blotting out of ſinne, intimates it fair written, as an evidence or a record againſt us,
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:40455:313"/> till a pardon blots it out. In which ſence, Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>have blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was against us,</hi> Col. 2. 14. Thy ſins (O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo the Lord ſeems to ſpeak in the Prophet) are as a cloud to hinder the ſhining of the light of my countenance upon thee: like blots, they hinder thee, from reading the evidences of my favour, or they ſtand like evidences of guilt againſt thee. But I have blotted out this cloud, that is, I have pardon'd thy ſins, and by the breath of my favour and free grace, ſcatter'd thy tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with all the evils and ſequels, which they naturally bring forth. So that, now the light ſhines fair and warm upon thee; the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were againſt thee, cannot be read, and thou mayeſt read the evidences of my love, and mercy towards thee. <hi>The ſins of the Saints are but vaniſhing clouds,</hi> whereas ſin in it ſelfe, and the ſins of all thoſe, who are out of Chriſt, are an abiding cloud, they are a cloud firme and immoveable, like a mountain of braſs, or a rock of ſtone. Sins make ſuch a cloud, as no power in Heaven or earth is able to conſume, but the power of mercy, and a gale of love, breathing through the covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>And, as the life of man is compared by <hi>Job</hi> to a cloud, ſo, to that which is the matter of the cloud, by the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 4. verſe 14. where he puts the queſtion, what's the life of man? <hi>Is it not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away?</hi> A vapour is exhaled from the earth by the heat of the Sunne, and is the matter out of which the cloud is made. Mans life is not only like a cloud, which is more condenſe and <hi>ſtrong,</hi> but like thoſe thin vapours, ſometimes obſerved ariſing from mooriſh grounds, which are the original of clouds, and more vaniſhing then clouds. Even theſe, are but vaniſhing enough, to ſhadow the vaniſhing, decaying, quickly diſ-appearing life of man. As the cloud conſumes and vaniſhes, (the next words ſpeak out the mind of the compariſon.)</p>

The clouds are like bottles full of raine, or ſpunges full of water, God cruſhes theſe ſpunges, or unſtops theſe bottles, and they are emptied, and in emptying vaniſh away: but yet <hi>Solomon</hi> affirms, <hi>the clouds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn after raine,</hi> how then doth <hi>Job</hi> ſay, that as the cloud vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſo man goeth to the grave and returns no more?</p>

                  <p> In that place of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Solomon</hi> is only giving us a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of old age, and the ſad condition of man in it; he calleth it the <hi>evil day;</hi> and wiſheth men would be wiſe to conſider their <hi>latter end,</hi> remembring their Creatour, and laying up a good foundation, before thoſe <hi>evil dayes</hi> overtake them, <hi>before the light of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars be darkened, and the clouds return after the raine;</hi> In old age, the clouds returne after the raine, thus: as in ſome very wet time, when we think it hath rained ſo much, as might have ſpent and quite exhauſted the clouds, or drawn thoſe bottles dry, yet you ſhall ſee them return again, it wil rain day after day as faſt as ever; ſo in old age, when rheumes diſtil ſo freely, that you would think an old man had emptied himſelfe of all, yet the clouds will return again, and flouds of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery humours overflow. Thus the clouds of old age returne; And in this ſence the clouds of the ayre returne, after they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and ſpent into raine: But how doth a cloud return? not the ſame cloud numerically, that cloud, which was diſſolved doth not return; the ſame Sunne goes down, and vaniſheth out of our ſight in the Evening, and returneth again, the ſame indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual and numerical Sun, in the morning; but that numerical cloud which vaniſhed, comes not again: Thus man vaniſheth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns as the clouds return after the raine, that is, after one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Si id quod nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Places are without life and without ſenſe, much more without knowledge; knowing is an act of reaſon, how is it then ſaid, <hi>his place ſhall know him no more?

                  <p>
                     <hi>That God hath given us not only the book of Scripture, but the book of the creature, therein to learn and read our own frailty and mortality.</hi> The creatures preach what man is, and that is a
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:40455:315"/> reaſon why the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> ſpends ſo much time; and is ſo frequent in giving us the meaſure of our ſelves by creatures; theſe are every houre in our eye, we meet with, and ſee, and handle, and feel them continually: The wind, the vapours, the clouds, ſet forth what we are, <hi>When I conſider</hi> (ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 8. 3. 4.) <hi>the Heavens, the work of thy fingers, the Moone, and the Starres which thou haſt ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what is man that thou art mindfull of him?</hi> To conſider the greatneſſe of the works of God, ſhould abaſe man; it ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze us, to remember, that God hath made ſuch things for our uſe, who are our ſelves ſo uſeleſſe (in compariſon of what we ought) to God. And when man conſiders the Heavens and the earth, and weighs how many things there are in them, which ſet forth his frailty, he hath reaſon to cry out, <hi>O Lord what is man?</hi> Man is but a wind, a cloud, a vapour, even ſuch a thing, as I ſee moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and vaniſhing in the whole compaſſe of the creation. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19. 1. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>But as the heavens declare the glory of God, ſo they publiſh and declare the weakneſſe of man, the vapours and the winds ſhew forth, how fraile he is: <hi>As the inviſible things of God, to wit, his eternall power and Godhead, are ſeen in the things which are made; God is</hi> (as it were) <hi>viſible in the creatures;</hi> ſo likewiſe the frailty and mutability, the weakneſſe and inconſtancy of man, is viſible in the things, which are created; we may reade a lecture of our own tranſitorineſſe, in the moſt tranſitory texts of nature: And that is an admirable contrivance and complication of things, that out of the very ſame text of the creature, where the infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; power of God may be learned, man alſo may learn his own frailty: <hi>He that ſtudies the creature much, ſhall find much of God and of himſelfe,</hi> Some conceive when <hi>Iſaac (Gen,</hi> 24. 63.) went forth into the field to meditate, that he ſtudied the booke of the creatures, probably the holy man did ſo, but, we are ſure he might.

<pb n="623" facs="tcp:40455:317"/> to God in the maine, though his ſpirit was preſerved untoucht of blaſpheming, yet we find him touching too often, and too loud upon this ſtring of complaining. He cannot be excuſed from ſome moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of impatience, while we hear him ſetling upon theſe reſolutions to take his fill of, or to let looſe the reins of his paſſion to complain, <hi>I will complaine in the bitterneſs of my ſoul.

                  <p>Having thus reſolved to complain, he complains in this very high Language.</p>
                  <q>Verſe 12. <hi>Am I a ſea, or a whale, that thou ſetteſt a watch over me?</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Theſe are his firſt words, words full of deep complaint, like the ſea, which, whether he was or no, he would be anſwered. <hi>Am I a ſea? Tell me.</hi> His queſtion is of like importance with that, at the 12. verſe of the 6. Chapter, <hi>Is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones, or is my fleſh braſſe?</hi> He expoſtulates with God, why haſt thou laid ſuch trouble upon me? Am I ſtone or braſs that I ſhould be able to bear it? And here like a ſea ſwolne with bitter waters) in the bitterneſs of his ſoul he begins to break the bounds again, <hi>Am I a ſea or a whale, that thou ſetteſt a watch over me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>A ſea or a whale.</q>
                  <p>The ſea and the whale are often joyned in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 25, 26. <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the earth is full</hi>
                     <pb n="624" facs="tcp:40455:318"/> 
                     <hi>of thy riches, ſo is the great and the wide ſea, there goe the ſhips, there is that Leviathan, whom thou haſt made to play therein.</hi> Againe, Pſal. 74. 13. 14. <hi>Thou diddeſt divide the ſea by thy ſtrength, thou brakeſt the heads of the dragons in the waters, thou brakeſt the head of Leviathan in pieces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why doth <hi>Job</hi> ſpeake this language? In briefe, the meaning is this. The ſea, you know, is a mighty boiſterous and unruly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the whale is the ſtrongeſt, mighteſt and moſt dreadfull creature in the ſea; the greateſt of the creatures, whether upon ſea or land. The ſea is the moſt boiſterous of all the inanimate creatures, and the whale is the moſt boiſterous of all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: So that here <hi>Job</hi> gives inſtance in two creatures, which are the moſt head-ſtrong, violent and out-ragious in the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>The whale and the ſea.</hi> And he ſets forth his own weakneſſe, by the Antitheſis of theſe two creatures, ſurpaſſing all in ſtrength with which God only is able to graple and encounter. And in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <hi>Am I a ſea or a whale,</hi> he may be conceived to ſpeake thus, <hi>Lord thou ſeemeſt to deale with me in a way beyond all thy dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with the children of men; Thou carrieſt thy ſelfe towards me, as if I were more proud, heady, hard to be reclaimed, then any man in the world; thou ſeemeſt to take ſuch a courſe with me, as with the unruly ſea, and with the boiſterous whale, to keepe me in compaſſe.</hi> He ſpeaks as if God laid too heavy an affliction upon him, and tooke too ſtrong a courſe to tame him, or, as if he might be more gently dealt with, and that God needed not prepare ſuch bonds and fetters for him, or lay ſuch law upon him, as upon the mighty ſea, and the monſtrous whale.</p>
                  <p>But for the words in particular.</p>
                  <q>Am I a ſea?</q>
                  <p>There are three things in the ſea, ſpecially conſiderable, at which <note place="margin">Mare barbarum &amp; indomitum elementum eſt.</note>

                  <p>Firſt, the turbulency of the ſea; the ſea is ſtormy and turbulent, ſo ſtormy and turbulent, that it threatneth to over-whelme all; to over-whelme the ſhips ſailing upon it, to over-whelme the <note place="margin">Viſat eſt Deus conjeciſſe mare in carcerem, at<expan>

                  <p>Secondly, there is a wonderfull capaciouſneſſe in the ſea: the ſea is ſo bigge and broad, ſo extenſive and vaſt, that it takes in all the waters that come off the land into it's boſome, and yet feeles no acceſſe. And then his meaning may be thus conceived, <hi>Am I able to drinke in all theſe flouds of ſorrow, and rivers of affliction, which are let out and unburthen themſelves upon me?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>The providence of God watches over all his creatures;</hi> All their motions are by his permiſſion or commiſſion, they ſtirre, not but by his leave. The providence of God is his watch, and therfore it is called the <hi>eye of providence;</hi> and providence hath ſuch an eye, as never ſleeps nor ſlumbers; and therein lieth our ſecurity, that we have a <hi>providentiall eye</hi> open for us, when ours are ſhut and we aſleep. Secondly, obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God expreſſes moſt care to keepe thoſe creatures from hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting man, which are most apt to hurt man.</hi> We ſee <hi>Job</hi> inſtances in theſe two by name, the <hi>ſea and the whale,</hi> and tels us, that God puts a guard upon them, he watches the leaſt cretures, but it ſpeaks moſt ſecurity to man, to hear that theſe are under a <hi>watch.</hi> The Lord watches over all wicked men, that they ſhould not hurt his people, but ſuch of them as are moſt harmefull, who are very <hi>ſeas</hi> and <hi>whales,</hi> men who would ſwollow and drowne his people with a deluge of rage and malice, over theſe the Lord watches in a ſpecial manner. His eye of jealouſie (which is alwaies awake) is ſurely wakefull upon theſe. As the Lord hath a ſpeciall eye upon the Saints to doe them good, ſo he hath a ſpeciall eye upon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that they doe no hurt, or no more, then ſhall turne to good. Hence the Pſalmiſt admoniſhes all, and it may have a particular application to wicked men, Pſal. 32. 9. <hi>Be yee not as the horſe, or as the mule which have no underſtanding: whoſe mouth muſt be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come neare unto thee.</hi> If the Lord ſees men ſo brutiſh, that they will not be ruled by reaſon, he will rule them by rigour, <hi>He hath a whip for the Horſe, a bridle</hi>
                     <pb n="628" facs="tcp:40455:320"/> 
                     <hi>for the Aſſe, and a rod for the fools back,</hi> (Prov. 26. 3.) A rocky ſhore for the ſea, and a priſon for the whale, rather then they ſhall come neare to hurt his beloved people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, note, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man in the paſſion, and diſtempered ſinfullneſſe of his nature, is like the ſea or the whale.</hi> A cruell man is as hurtfull, as the moſt hurtfull creature. In the place before noted, while man is warned, <hi>Not to be as the horſe, or as the mule, which have no underſtanding.</hi> It is intimated that many men are; and it is a truth, that all men left to themſelves would be like unto a horſe or a mule, yea like unto a ſea or a whale in doing miſchiefe. The Prophet <hi>(Iſai.</hi> 57. 20) compares wicked men <hi>unto the troubled ſea that cannot reſt.</hi> There is not in the whole compaſſe of nature, a clearer ſhadow of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than the ſea.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſea is very vaſt, and would (if let alone) be bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, Man is naturally vaſt and boundleſſe in his deſires, he is never ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſea is unſtable, alwayes fleeting and moving, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 3. Dying <hi>Jacob</hi> characters <hi>Reuben</hi> thus, <hi>unſtable at wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> The heart of man is a moveable thing, ebbing and flowing forward and backward, tumbling up and downe, as the vaſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſea is often provoked with ſtormes and tempeſts, it is the great ſtage, where the winds act their parts, and ſtrive, as it is expreſt in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> There are many winds ſtriving upon the ſea of mans heart continually, and therefore he is ſo boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, and ſo ſtormy; he hath winds within him, and winds from without him; The winds in his own bowels make the greateſt commotions. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> queſtions (Chap. 4. 1.) <hi>Whence comes contentions and warrs, and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your luſts, that warre in your members?</hi> Luſts are as boiſterous winds in the ſoule, which make it unquiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly; ſtrong luſts and deſires like ſtrong winds; and contrary luſts and deſires like contrary winds, contend upon this ſea. Moſt men are (Tit. 3. 3.) <hi>ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> not only many, but divers, or divers not only in number, but in nature, one luſt as a contrary wind, ſtriving with another, and ſo making a ſtorme in the heart. And this ſtormineſſe is cauſed alſo by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blaſt; Satan blowes upon the heart, and the world blowes: ſo that, till the holy Ghoſt breaths heavenly gales to overcome and
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:40455:320"/> blow downe thoſe ſtormes raiſed by the blaſt of ſtrongluſts and temptations, the ſoul will be ever like a ſea tumbled up and down, or, as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks (verſ. 13.) like a <hi>raging wave of the ſea, foming out it's own ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is further conſiderable, that as the ſea is moſt turbulent and tempeſtious, moſt loud and roaring about the bankes, where it is reſtrained; ſo man is moſt boyſterous, where he is kept in and ſtopt; if God doe but ſet bounds to him by afflictions, he begins to rage at thoſe bounds. It is that which <hi>Iob</hi> (in a degree) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of, he thought God would bind and bound him in by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and he began to be ſomewhat unquiet in his ſhackles. But when God ſets bounds to wicked men by afflictions, and hedges up their way with thornes, they are angry indeed, &amp; their corruptions breake forth the more, by how much the ſtronger banks are made againſt them. The great banke and bound, which God hath ſet up to keepe the luſts of men from over-flowing all, <hi>his word and will, his laws and ordinances,</hi> by which he ſpeaks to man, as to the ſea, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no further;</hi> Againſt theſe bankes, the hearts of men naturally rage moſt. How doe their luſts roare and riſe up againſt the holy and righteous will of God, there the fome of their corruptions is moſt wrought and caſt up. As <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe acknowledged of his naturall condition, Rom. 7. 8. <hi>Sinne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>taking occaſion by the law, wrought in me, all manner of concupiſcence,</hi> my luſts and corruptions were more mad, becauſe they were more reſtrained, I was like the ſea, which makes moſt noiſe at, and moſt aſſaults the bankes which ſtay it. So ver. 13. <hi>Sinne that it might appeare ſinne, wrought death in me by that which is good;</hi> there was a good, a holy, and a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous law ſet before me, but the baſeneſſe of my heart was ſuch, that I was the worſe, for that, which taught me what was good, and ſhould have made me better.</p>
                  <p>Further, man is as a ſea in this, he ever caſts up mire and dirt when he is moved, corruption moves, every ſtirring ſtirrs up the pudle of his heart. As he is a ſea for largeneſſe, ſo he is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinke for filthineſſe, Iſa. 57. 20. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled ſea, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Covetous oppreſſours have a nearer reſemblance to the ſea in three things. They (as the ſea) ſuck in all the rivers and ſtreames of profit, which flow into them, from any part of the world, and yet are not filled.</p>
                  <pb n="630" facs="tcp:40455:321"/>
                  <p> Secondly, They (as the ſea) wrack and over-whelme thouſands, and are not at all moved with their out-cries.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They (as the ſea) have huge treaſures in their houſes, yet all ſatisfies not their deſires, they are as greedy, as if they were not worth a groat.</p>
                  <p>Looke upon man, in the other compariſon, He is a whale, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer. In the worſt of bruits, you may ſee the picture of mans nature. They who have power to doe what they will, and will doe (when their advantage is in it) to the utmoſt of their power; Theſe are your Leviathans upon dry land. <hi>Senacherib</hi> was a mighty whale, gaping to ſwallow up the people of God, and therefore the Lord expreſſes his dealing with him in a word very ſutable to this ſence (2 King. 19. 28.) <hi>Becauſe thy rage againſt me, and thy tumult is come up into mine eares, therefore I will put my hooke in thy noſe, and my bridle in thy lips,</hi> &amp;c. See how God uſes him, <hi>Senacherib</hi> came raging and threatning to ſwallow all up; God uſes him like an unruly beaſt of the earth, or like a devouring fiſh of the ſea, <hi>He puts a hooke in his noſe,</hi> It is ſaid of Leviathan, that he ſcorns the hooke and the angle, Job 41. <hi>Canſt thou draw out Leviathan with an hooke?</hi> implying that no hook, no tackle is ſtrong enough to hold this ſea-monſter, but God hath a hooke can hold him. Some men are like this ſea-monſter, no tackling of mans making will hold them, no power under heaven can ſtop them; then the Lord prepares his engines and inctru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he can make a hooke will catch <hi>Senacherib</hi> the <hi>great whale,</hi> as if he were but a <hi>ſprat, I will put my hook into his noſe, and turne him about or pull him up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What devouring enemies have come out againſt us, threatning to ſwollow, or, as the Moabites ſaid of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Num. 22. 4.) <hi>to licke up all that were round about, as the oxe licketh up the graſſe of the field.</hi> Yea, they thought (as it is ſaid of Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than) <hi>that they could draw up Iordan into their mouths,</hi> that is, remove the greateſt difficulties, and overcome all oppoſition. But how often hath God put a bridle into the lips of the horſe, and a hooke into the noſe of theſe whales?</p>
                  <p>Further, if we conſider the words, as <hi>Iobs</hi> queſtion, in appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto himſelfe, <hi>Am I a whale? Am I a ſea?</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man is apt to have good thoughts of himſelf. Iob</hi> would not be the whale, or the ſea. Secondly note,</p>
                  <pb n="631" facs="tcp:40455:321"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Man is apt to judge that God layes more upon him than there is need. Am I a whale or a ſea?</hi> as if <hi>Iob</hi> had ſaid, Lord thou needeſt not deale thus ſtrictly and ſeverely with me, or beſtow ſo much care to watch me. I would have come in at a call, thou needeſt not have bounded me with theſe afflictions, and put ſuch a hooke in my noſe, a nod, or a beck would have fetched me in: Wiſe men ſuite their preparations to their occaſion; we carry not out a peece of Ordinance to ſhoot at a flye, which we can kill with a phillip; ſo ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Lord I need not all this, a little admonition, a little chaſtning, or a check ſhould have reduced me, ſuch are mans thoughts. But the moſt wiſe God, never layes more upon man, than he hath need of: when God ſtreightens us with ſuch affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he ſeeth there is ſomewhat of the ſea in us, he muſt bound us, ſomewhat of the whale in us, he muſt watch and bring us under. If we ſee God beſtow more rods and blowes upon us, we muſt conclude, we could not be without them; ſome apprehend, that ſuch is <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning in the ſixteenth verſe, <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him?</hi> as if he had ſaid, it is too great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for man to be afflicted by thy hand. If we ſee a King make great proviſions of warre, to goe out againſt an enemy, we ſay he magnifies the enemy. <hi>It is an argument they have great ſtrength, againſt whom we prepare great ſtrength.</hi> So <hi>Job,</hi> Lord thou mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieſt me, thou makeſt me to be lookt at, as ſome powerful creature, a ſea, a whale, againſt whom thou acteſt ſo much of thy power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having, as he reſolved, begun to complaine of his ſorrows, now amplifies them.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>He ampliſies his ſorrows upon this generall ground, becauſe they were ſuch, as he could not find any eaſe or abatement of, no not at any time, no not by any meanes; As if he had ſaid, my griefe and my paine is ſo remedileſſe, that, neither artificiall nor naturall meanes give me any eaſe; thoſe things, which have the greateſt probability of refreſhing, yeeld me none. He inſtances in thoſe ordinary wayes, which give ſick and diſtempered bodies ſome abatement or intermiſſion of their paines <hi>lying down upon their bed or couch; When I ſay, my bed ſhall comfort me, my chouch ſhall eaſe my complaint,</hi> As if he had ſaid, while I was
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:40455:322"/> wraſtling all day, and conflicting with my ſorrowes, I yet had ſome hope to find comfort at night, and that I ſhould meete with reſt in my bed, but my hope failes me ever: or while in the day time my thoughts are overburthened, and my ſpirit overwhelmed within me, I think ſometimes to deceive my paines a little, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a nap or a ſlumber upon my couch; but alas, my paines will not be deceived, <hi>when I ſay, my bed ſhall comfort me, my couch ſhall eaſe my complaint (I find in ſtead of eaſe, farther trouble, and in ſtead of comfort, terrours.

                  </p>
                  <q>When I ſay my bed ſhall comfort me.</q>
                  <p>The word ſignifies to mourne and repent, as well as to comfort; <note place="margin">

                     <hi>That a man in paine, expects eaſe from every change.

As a Bee goes from flower to flower, to ſuck out ſomewhat, ſo man from inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to inſtrument, from meanes to meanes, from bed to couch, ſtill hoping to find reliefe or mitigation at leaſt for his troubled mind, or pained body. Secondly obſerve hence,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the moſt probable or proper meanes, are unable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to give us any eaſe or comfort.</hi> What is fitter to give a man reſt than a bed? what is more proper to give one refreſhing than a couch? but <hi>Job</hi> goes to his bed in vaine, and goes to his couch in vaine, nor this, nor that, nor tother adminiſtred him any help. Creatures are not able of themſeves to give out the comforts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them: Their common nature muſt be aſſiſted with a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall word of bleſſing, or elſe they doe us no good. If God will command a bed to comfort us, it ſhall comfort us, if he will ſay to a couch, eaſe ſuch a mans complaint, it ſhall eaſe his complaint; <hi>Job</hi> ſaith it, and his ſaying could not effect it: Nay, if God will ſay to a hard ſtone, give ſuch a man reſt, he ſhall reſt and ſleepe ſweetly upon it; when another ſhall not get a wink of ſleep upon
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:40455:323"/> a downe pillow: If God ſay to a priſon, give ſuch a man reſt, he ſhall find reſt there: if God ſpeake to bonds and fetters, give ſuch a man content and pleaſure, he ſhall find not only contentment, but pleaſure in bonds and fetters: if God ſay to flames of fire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh ſuch as are caſt into your armes, the fire will obey him, and refreſh them: The moſt probable meanes cannot help us of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and a word from God will make the moſt improbable meanes helpfull to us, yea that which is deſtructive ſhall ſave us. For as God can create that good for us which is abſent, ſo he can (as it were) uncreate the evill that is preſent; Providence can take away or ſuſpend that hurting and deſtroying power which creation gave; no creature is able to help or to hurt, if God forbid and lay his reſtraint upon it. Bread cannot nouriſh, or cloathes warme us, if he ſay they ſhall not; poiſon ſhall not kill, or fire burne us, if he ſay they ſhall not. <hi>Mans ſaying is but ſaying; Gods ſaying is doing,</hi> Man may ſay to his bed, comfort me; to his riches and honours, content me; to his wife and children, pleaſe me; to wine and muſick, make me merry; he may lay his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or ſend his deſires to all creatures, and yet remaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe, contentleſſe, mirthleſſe. Pleaſure it ſelfe will not pleaſe him, nor the having of his will, ſatisfie his mind at his own ſaying or biding. Obſerve in the fourth place;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That reſt and ſleepe, are from the eſpeciall bleſſing of God.</hi> When I ſaid to my bed, do it, the bed could not, ſleepe is not from a ſoft bed, or from an eaſie couch. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 2. <hi>For ſo he giveth his beloved ſleepe;</hi> that is, ſleepe with quietneſſe, or extraordinary quiet refreſhing ſleepe; which ſome have noted in the Grammar of the text; The Hebrew word <hi>Shena,</hi> for ſleepe, being with <hi>(Aleph)</hi> a quiet or reſting letter, otherwiſe, than is uſuall in that language.

Some referre it to the words of the firſt verſe, <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vaine that build it; except the Lord keep the City, the watchman waketh but in vaine, for ſo he giveth his beloved ſleepe,</hi> the Lord watches and takes a care of
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:40455:323"/> a City and family, and thus gives his people reſt, and quiet ſleep, they are not awakened with alarms or ſurprizes of the enemy: Others reade it thus, for <hi>ſurely he will give his, &amp;c.</hi> that is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ungodly are eaten up with cares to provide bread for themſelves and families to eate, yet without faile, the Lord of his meere mercy will give food convenient to his people by their labours, and quiet ſleepe (which includes all inward content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) with it. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Thou ſhall lie downe, and thy ſleep ſhall be ſweet;</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 3. there is a ſpeciall promiſe made to the ſick man, or to him, who hath been a comforter of the ſick, <hi>The Lord will make all his bed in his ſickneſſe;</hi> that is, God will make his bed eaſie and comfortable in his ſickneſſe. When we cannot ſleepe, we uſe to complaine of our ſervants, and ſay, ſure this bed was not made to night, or it was ill made; no man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his bed was ill made, when he hath ſlept well: That his people in ſuch a caſe may be ſure of reſt, the Lord condeſcends to that low office, the making of their beds, Therefore we are to receive ſleep as a matter of ſpeciall bleſſing, coming from the hand of God; he makes the bed in ſicknes, and in health too; then bleſſe God for reſt, and not your beds. Though we know ſleep is the portion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and many times the worſt of men have quiet and refreſhing ſleepe; yet no wicked man ever ſlept upon the pillow of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor will God make the bed of the greateſt Prince in the world, as ſuch, which yet, he is ready to doe for his meaneſt ſervant; <hi>common comforts, are to ſome ſpeciall mercies.</hi> As ſome enjoy riches and honour by common providence, while others enjoy them by vertue of a ſpecial promiſe, ſo it is with ſleep, <hi>He giveth his beloved ſleep.</hi>

                     </note> there can be no dreame: <hi>Jacob</hi> dreamed <hi>(Gen.</hi> 28. 12.) <hi>and behold a ladder ſet upon the earth, and the top of it reached to Heaven.</hi> The viſion here ſpoken of, was (I conceive) the viſion of his dreame, though ſome underſtand it of day or waking viſion.</p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold cauſe of dreames: There is an inward cauſe, and an outward cauſe. And</p>
                  <p>The inward cauſe of dreames is two-fold:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The accidentall motions of the fancie, of which a man can give no reaſon from any precedent agitation of mind or body.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſetled naturall temperament and conſtitution of the body.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The externall or outward cauſes, are uſually according to the objects with which, or about which we are converſant in the day time, the impreſſions of theſe kept in the fancie, are formed
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:40455:324"/> into dreames at night; ſuch as the deſires or diſtempers of the mind are, ſuch often are our dreames.</p>
                  <p>Or take it thus. Dreames may have a five fold cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The natural temper of the body, and ſo from the variety of conſtitutions, variety of dreames are ſhaped; Cholerick, or Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, or Flegmatique, or Sanguin, produce their ſpeciall dreames.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Dreames are cauſed by the diſtempers of the body, either from intemperate drinking, or eating any kind of meate, or from the very eating (though moderately) of ſome meates, or from the diſeaſes and ſickneſſes of the body; from this latter <hi>Jobs</hi> dreames were much encreaſed, and Satan took the advantage to raiſe fumes, and ſtirre the pudled humours of his body up into his braine, out of which his fancie formed terrible repreſentations to his mind. As Melancholy is ſaid to be the <hi>Devils bath,</hi> ſo are other diſeaſed ſickly humours; in them he ſports himſelf, and vexes man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a morall cauſe of dreames; ſuch as the ſtudies and buſineſſes, labours and imployments, cares and diſquietments <note place="margin">

                  <p>Fourthly, Dreames have a divine cauſe, and are immediately from God. The Scripture is full of inſtances, I need not ſtay upon them: <hi>Jacob</hi> had ſuch a dreame, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 16. and <hi>Joſpeh</hi> had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dreames from God: Hence his brethren called him in ſcorne, <hi>The dreamer,</hi> or a <hi>Captaine Dreamer,</hi> Gen. 37. 19. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have godly men dreames from God, but heathens alſo, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and <hi>Nebuchnazzar,</hi> men of the earth received dreames from Heaven, of high concernment, revealing the counſels of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their own Kingdoms, and the latter about the ſtate of all Kingdoms and Monarchies, till all the Kingdomes of the earth ſhall become the Kingdoms of <hi>that One, ſole, Supreame Monarch, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, There are diabolicall dreames, dreames which are from the Devill: Not that the Devill of himſelfe is able to cauſe a dreame, he cannot ſtirre the fancie in the night, or tempt in the day, but as he hath a power given him; but permitted, he cauſes ſometimes ſinfull and fifthly dreames; as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> bewailes in the tenth book of his Confeſſions: ſometimes terrible and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug. confeſſ. li.</hi> 10. <hi>Ca.</hi> 30.</note> dreames, ſometimes treacherous and deluding dreames. It is by ſome conceived, that the dreame of <hi>Pilats</hi> wife, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 19.
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:40455:325"/> was from the Devill: ſhe comes to <hi>Pilat,</hi> and deſires him to have nothing to doe with that Juſt man: <hi>for</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>I have ſuffered many things this night in a dreame, becauſe of him.</hi> The reaſon why ſome conceive that dreame was from the Devill, is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby Satan would have hindred the work of mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, if Chriſt had not died, and ſo by ſaving him, would have deſtroyed us all. I will not aſſert this; but it is cleare to the point in hand, that there are dreames from the temptations, motions and ſuggeſtions of the Devill, who hath a power over us, as God leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens out his chain both day and night.</p>
                  <p>But, when it is ſaid, <hi>Thou skareſt me with dreames,</hi> what dreames were theſe, <hi>divine or Diabolicall? Job</hi> ſpeaks unto God, <hi>Thou skareſt me with dreames:</hi> doubtleſſe divine dreames had an influence upon his ſpirit, and left terrifying impreſſions there. But Satan having power to afflict <hi>Job</hi> which way he pleaſed, was inſtrumentall here: and yet <hi>Job</hi> ſaith to God, <hi>Thou skareſt me.</hi> As before, when Satan by his inſtruments took away all from him, he ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath taken;</hi> ſo here, when Satan vexed him with viſions, repreſenting horrid and fearfull ſpectacles, yet he ſaith; <hi>Thou skareſt me with dreames, and terrifieſt me with viſions,</hi> as pointing ſtill unto the power and providence of God, who hath all ſecond cauſes, Satan and all, at his own diſpoſe. Obſerve here, firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That even our dreames are ordered by God.</hi> Though Satan be the inſtrument, yet we may ſay, <hi>Thou skareſt me with dreames, and terrifieſt me with viſions. Job</hi> was not ignorant, that ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had a great power upon the body, to produce dreames and nightly fancies; he was not ignorant, that the ſtrength of a diſeaſe might doe very much in this, and that Satan his former enemy was buſie to improve the diſtempers of his body for the trouble of his mind: yet he overlooks all theſe (as he did before) and ſaith, <hi>Lord thou skareſt me with dreames, and terrifieſt me with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> Dreames are in the hand of God: As our waking times are in the hand of God, ſo are our ſleeping times: when we are ſleeping we are in the armes of an ever waking Father: Satan hath not power to touch us, ſleeping or waking, without leave.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Ged can make our ſleepe an affliction. Jobs</hi> were ska<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and terrifying dreames: Some dreames are for warning and admonition; <hi>The Lord warned Joſeph in a dream:</hi> Some are for counſell and inſtruction, he revealed great things in dreames:
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:40455:325"/> Others are for comfort and conſolation. Many a ſoul hath taſted more of heaven in a night-dreame, than in many daies attendance upon holy Ordinances. As the luſts of wicked men have dreames attending them, ſo alſo have the graces of the Saints. <hi>Jobs</hi> dreames were for terrour and afflictions. Obſerve ſecondly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Satans deſire of troubling poore ſouls, is reſtleſſe.</hi> It is reſtleſſe indeed, for he will not give them leave to reſt, they ſhall not ſleep in quiet, their very dreames ſhall be diſtractions, and their nightly repreſentations, a vexation to them. Note further,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That (if God permit) Satan can make dreames very terrible to us.</hi> He can ſhew himſelfe in a dreame, and offer ugly ſights, extreamly perplexing to the Spirit. He is able to caſt himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a thouſand ill favour'd ſhapes, into horrid and dreadfull ſhapes, he can cloath himſelf with what habit he pleaſes, if God give him a generall Commiſſion. And hence the devill terrifies, not only by temptations to the mind, but by aparitions to the eye, and is ſeen, at leaſt conceived to be ſeen (eſpecially by ſuch as labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtrong diſeaſes) like a Lion, a Beare, a Dogge, gaping, grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſtaring: whence we ſay of any terrifying ſight, it looks like a devill. We depend upon God, as for ſleep, ſo for the comfort of ſleep. Many lie downe to ſleep and their ſleep is their terrour. As that evill ſpirit (in the Goſpel) <hi>went about ſeeking rest, but found none:</hi> So he hinders ſome, (and would more) from finding reſt, when they ſeeke it. Therefore bleſſe God for any refreſhing you have by ſleepe: Bleſſe God when your dreames are not your skares, nor your beds your racke. See the effect, what deepe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, dreadfull dreams made in <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit, he was ſo affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them, that he profeſſes with his next breath.</p>
                  <q>Verſe 15. <hi>My ſoule chuſeth ſtrangling, and death rather then life, I loath it, I would not live alwayes.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So that my ſoul chooſeth ſtrangling.]</hi> He renews his former often repeated motion, but with a greater ardency; He not only prefers death before his troubled condition, but a violent death, and (in the opinion of ſome) the worſt of violent deaths, <hi>ſtrangling,</hi> which though it be not the moſt painfull of violent deaths, yet it is looked upon as the moſt ignominious of violent deaths.</p>
                  <p>Some referre theſe words to the terrour which <hi>Job</hi> had in his dreames and viſions, as if they were ſo violent upon him, that they almoſt diſtracted him, and made him mad, that they even put
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:40455:326"/> him upon deſperate thoughts of deſtroying himſelfe: <hi>My ſoule chooſeth strangling,</hi> that is, I am often tempted and almoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed <note place="margin">

The learned Phyſitians tell us, that their Patients have often attempted to deſtroy themſelves tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the terrours of dreams and viſions.</p>
                  <p>Yet we may underſtand the word <hi>[ſtrangling]</hi> only of naturall and ordinary. Every death is a kind of ſtrangling; and ſome diſeaſes ſtop and choke a man even as ſtrangling doth; ſo that, <hi>My ſoule chooſeth ſtrangling,</hi> may be taken in generall, <hi>My ſoul chooſeth death rather then life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>My ſoul chooſeth.</q>
                  <p>He puts the ſoul (as it is often in Scripture) for the whole man; and the ſence of all is, as if he had ſaid, <hi>If I might be my own chooſer, if I might have my election, I would even take the worſt of deaths rather than the life which now I live. My ſoul chooſeth ſtrangling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And death rather then life.</q>
                  <p>If we take ſtrangling for a ſpeciall death, then here <hi>death</hi> is put in generall; As thus, if ſtrangling be too eaſie a death, let me die any kind of death, <hi>Death rather then life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew in the letter is, <hi>And death rather than my bones,</hi> which ſome render thus, <hi>And death rather than to be with my</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That which a man loatheth, he longs to be rid of. I loath it, I would no live alway.</hi> When a man loaths his ſin, then he ſaith, <hi>I would not ſin alway.</hi> I would be eaſed of this burthen of corruption, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death.</hi> When a man delights in ſinne, he would ſinne alway, he thinkes he can never have enough of ſinning: it is ſo in any other inſtance; where once affection is alienated, we would be eſtranged, and taken off from converſation: We care not to be with that from which our hearts are departed. Aſſoone as ever <hi>Amnon,</hi> had defiled, he loathes his ſiſter, and aſſoone as he loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed her, he turned her out of doores, <hi>And Amnon ſaid unto her, ariſe and be gone,</hi> 2 Sam. 13. 15. He that loathes his life, is glad when a doore opens for it's departure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I loath it, I would not live alway.</hi> Secondly, obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trouble makes a little time ſeeme long.</hi> He had ſaid before, that his <hi>life was ſwifter then a Weavers ſhuttle;</hi> now, <hi>I would not live alway;</hi> O how long is my life, how tedious! He lookes upon it, as if it were a kind of eternity, as if his life would never have an end, never be done, <hi>I would not live alway.</hi> Paine makes every houre a day, and every day a moneth, and every moneth a yeare, yea an age. <hi>He thinks his life will never end, whoſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth not;</hi> he thinkes he ſhall never die, becauſe his troubles live. Every man is ready to ſay, he lives too long, when he lives not, as he would. The ſoules under the Altar cried out <hi>(Revel.</hi> 6. 10.) <hi>How long Lord, how long Lord, wilt thou ceaſe to avenge, &amp;c.</hi> of our good dayes we complaine, <hi>How ſhort Lord, how ſhort?</hi> And of our evill daies we cry out, <hi>How long Lord, how long?</hi> This is a long day, and this a long night indeed, this is a long fit, this a laſting affliction. <hi>As the eternity which we ſhall have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                     <pb n="644" facs="tcp:40455:328"/> 
                     <hi>is the longeſt, ſo it is the ſhorteſt; Eternity is longeſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of duration, but it is ſhorteſt in regard of apprehenſion;</hi> The eternity of heaven ſhall be to us, no more tedious than a minut or a moment. Eternity is ſo full of pleaſure and ſatisfaction, that it breeds no fullneſſe of it ſelfe: living at the well head of comfort, in immediate communion with God by Jeſus Chriſt, our comforts renew as much as they continue; whence freſhneſſe of appetite, and fullneſſe of ſatisfaction, are perpetually interchangeable. The joyes of that eſtate are ſo many, that the yeares ſeeme but few. Eternall joy makes eternity, but as a moment, as eternall pain will make every moment an eternity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve; foraſmuch as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I would not live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies;</hi> he intimates, that there is ſuch a deſire in ſome men; for he ſpeaks of a life in this world;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a principle in man, drawing out his heart in deſires, to live alway in the world. I</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) would not live alway;</hi> let others make that their choice, if they will, I will not. Moſt are very greedy of that commodity, and would not part with it upon any termes: and no wonder, for (as the Pſalmiſt deſcribes them) <hi>They have their portion in this life;</hi> He that hath his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life, would ever have this life; he that hath nothing beyond this world, would never goe heyond the world. <hi>Such muſt needs be all for life, all for the world, becauſe theſe are their all.</hi> You ſhall never come to a worldly man, and find him in a mind to die, Let orhers take heaven, he is contented with his earth; let others make their beſt of the next life, the preſent ſhall ſerve his turne.</p>
                  <p>From the reaſon of this requeſt, <hi>My dayes are vanity,</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The life of man is a vain life.</hi> Vanity hath two things in it, whereof the one may ſeem quite contrary to the other; it hath emptineſſe in it, and it hath fulneſſe in it; it hath emptineſſe of comfort, and fulneſſe of vexation; that's the right vanity, <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with vexation of ſpirit; My daies are vanity,</hi> they are empty of good and full of evill.</p>
                  <p>Foure waies, the vanitie of mans dayes may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they are vaine comparatively: So our daies are more then vaine, or leſſe then vanity, for they are nothing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 5. <hi>Mine age is nothing before thee.</hi> As in compariſon of God
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:40455:328"/> 
                     <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 40. 15. 17,) <hi>The Nations are as the drop of a bucket,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they are vanity, yea they are nothing, yea they are counted to him leſſe then nothing;</hi> So our daies are vaine, they are nothing but vanity, they are leſſe than vanity, or nothing; <hi>Nothingneſſe is the ſubſtance of vanity, and all troubleſomeneſſe is the accident of it.</hi> We cannot forme up an apprehenſion of our life, ſo little as it is, we cannot reach ſo low in our thoughts, as the bottome of mans vanity, in either notion. As we are not able to raiſe our hearts ſo high, as the excellency of that eſtate, which we have by Chriſt; no mans thoughts are bigg enough, or can be, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or to take in that: So we cannot little our thoughts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conſider the eſtate, ſinne hath brought us into; therefore it is ſaid, to be as nothing, and leſſe than nothing, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that is, which is leſſe then nothing, no man can propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our dayes are vanity, becauſe they are ſo unconſtant and changeable, ſo ſubject to motion and alteration. That's a vaine thing which is ever upon it's change. That which ſets the glory of God higheſt in oppoſition to the vanity of the creature, is, <hi>That with him there is no variableneſſe, nor ſhaddow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. or, <hi>ſhaddow by turning;</hi> ſome tranſlate it ſo, no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow by turning, becauſe the Tropique or turning of the Sunne makes the ſhaddow: while the Sun is in the <hi>Zenith,</hi> that is, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over our heads in the higheſt point of the heavens, we caſt no ſhadows. Now the Lord never turneth, he is ever fixed at a point, and ſo makes no ſhaddow; or thus, as we render it, <hi>no ſhaddow of turning;</hi> that is, not only is there no turning in God, but there is not ſo much as a ſhaddow of it, not ſo much as the leaſt imagination of a ſhaddow. This ſets up the glory of God higheſt: And in oppoſition to this point of higheſt perfection in God, lies the loweſt point of the creature vanity: that in them there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but turning, in them there is nothing but variableneſs, and the ſubſtance of turning. The faſhion of the world paſſeth away, it is ever paſſing, never ſtanding at a ſtay. It is more then paſſing, it is poſting from ſtage to ſtage, night and day. As the nature of <note place="margin">Sicut bomo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in ſcipſo res velut mundus quidam, ita om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium mutatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſeminae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct.</note> man containes the ſeeds and principles of all things in the world (and is therefore called a <hi>little world.)</hi> So his nature contains the ſeeds and principles of all the changes in the world. Therefore his daies are vain.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the vanity of theſe daies appeares in this, becauſe they
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:40455:329"/> are unſatisfying dayes. That's a vaine thing, which doth not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie; for vanity is emptineſſe, and emptineſſe can never fill: our dayes are but as a dream. And what is ſpoken in <hi>Iſaias</hi> (Chap. 29. 8.) concerning the dreamer, is verified of a meere naturall life, It is ſaith the Prophet, <hi>As when a hungry man dreameth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he eateth; but he awaketh and his ſoule is empty; or, as when a thirſty man dreameth, and behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh and behold he is faint;</hi> neither hunger nor thirſt can be appeaſed by dreames, ſatisfaction comes not in at the doore of imagination. Our daies of themſelves can give us no more ſatisfaction, no better a break-faſt, then a dreame of meat and drinke doth to a hungry, or a thirſty man. <hi>All creatures are not able to fill one.</hi> There is a ſatisfaction which comes to us thorough the creature, but the creature doth not ſatisfie: God can make any thing ſatisfie, the leaſt of his creatures ſhall fill the greateſt. He can give us as much, as we expect from them, that is, looke what ſatisfaction a man would have from a creature, that God can give when he pleaſeth: But the daies of man are vanity in this, becauſe we cannot take this ſatisfaction our ſelves from the creature; neither is any creature able to give it us. When creatures have done their beſt, we are hungry and reſtleſſe ſtill, empty and unſatisfied ſtill. <hi>There is no reſt till we returne to God, or till God turne his face to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the vanity of our daies appears in this, that they are <hi>deceiveable daies;</hi> that's very vaine to us, which deceives us. And in this the great vanity of the creature conſiſts: it promiſeth much and performeth nothing. Great promiſes are made, and hopes are raiſed very high: Riches will tell us, what they will doe for us; and honours will tell us, what they will doe for us, and how happy they will make us; and the wine will tell us, O how that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us, and the ſweet and the fat will tell us, how they will fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us. All theſe make golden promiſes, but leaden performances. They cannot make good what they promiſe, unleſſe they can, with evill. As Satan ſaid to Chriſt, when he had not ſo much as a <hi>ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>chet</hi> to diſpoſe of, <hi>All this will I give thee:</hi> So the creature joyning with our hearts, makes wonderfull promiſes of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and then leaves us moſt diſcontented, <hi>This is vanity and vexation of mans ſpirit.</hi> If the creature were not ſo free to enter bond, and give us ſecurity, for the paiment of great good, it would not be ſo ill with us. If the creature would ſay directly to us, <hi>it is</hi>
                     <pb n="647" facs="tcp:40455:329"/> 
                     <hi>not in me,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> brings in the creatures diſclaiming wiſedome <hi>(chap.</hi> 28.) <hi>The ſea ſaith, it is not in me; and the earth ſaith, it is not in me;</hi> So if creatures would ſpeak plainly, comfort is not in us, help is not in us, ſatisfaction is not in us, and ſo tell us how vaine they are, their vanity were leſſe to us, though the ſame in it ſelfe. <hi>It is worſe to be deceived of good, then to want it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> of this life) <hi>every man walketh in a vaine ſhew,</hi> Pſal. 39. 6. there is a ſhew of this, and that, and the other <note place="margin">Qnaſi nihil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat humana vita verum &amp; ſolid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. It implies, only a manifeſtation or declaration of anothers greatneſſe, or an opening of his intrinſicall worth and dignity; in which ſence, man is often ſaid to magnifie God, he declares and publiſhes the infinite, internall worth and dignity of God. <hi>Luke.</hi> 1. 46. the Virgin beginneth her Song thus, <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord.</hi> It is impoſſible we ſhould give the leaſt addition to the greatneſſe of God: Then magnifying of God, is only a declaring that God is great: So, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 3. <hi>O magnifie the Lord with me,</hi> that is, let us joyne our hearts and our tongues in this great work, to lift up the honour and Name of our God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To magnifie, is to eſteeme or prize greatly: So the Apoſtle ſpeaking of his office, ſhewes how highly he priz'd it, by breaking forth into this holy boaſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>I magnifie mine Office.</hi> I eſteeme this as my greateſt priviledge and honour, that God hath called me to be an Apoſtle; And <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 19. when the Phariſees were ſo angry with the Apoſtles, and many were afraid to joyne
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:40455:331"/> with them, the text ſaith, <hi>the people magnified them,</hi> that is, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had high thoughts of them, and eſteemed them greatly.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly (which is chiefely intended in this place) to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, is, to make great, or to give ſome reall addition of worth and reſpect. Thus the Lord magnifies man; he magnifies him, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſomewhat to him, by giving glory and luſtre to man, who in himſelfe is vile, and mean, and contemptible. And thus God magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies man foure wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He magnifies man in the work of creation; of that we reade, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 4. where this queſtion is put, <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt be mindfull of him, or the ſonne of man that thou viſiteſt him;</hi> The third verſe ſhewes us, what it was which raiſed the Pſalmiſt to this admiration of the goodneſſe of God to man; <hi>When I behold the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the Moone and the Starres which thou haſt made; Lord what is man?</hi> God in the work of creation, made all theſe things ſerviceable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall for the good of man. What is man, that he ſhould have a Sun, a Moon and Stars planted in the firmament for him? what creature is this? when great preparations are made in any place, much proviſions layed in, and the houſe adorned with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt furnitures; We ſay, <hi>what is this man that comes to ſuch a houſe?</hi> when ſuch a goodly fabrique was raiſed up, the goodly houſe of the world adorned and furniſhed, we have reaſon, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſay; what is this man that muſt be the tenant, or inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of this houſe? There is yet a higher exaltation of man in the creation, man was magnified with the ſtampe of Gods image; one part whereof the Pſalmiſt deſcribes at the fift verſe; <hi>Thou haſt given him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou haſt put all things under his feet, all ſheepe and oxen, yea, and the beaſts of the field, the fowle of the aire, and the fiſh of the ſea, &amp;c.</hi> Thus man was magnified in creation. What was man that he ſhould have the rule of the world given him? that he ſhould be the Lord over the fiſh of the ſea, &amp; over the beaſts of the field, and over the foules of the ayr. Again, man was magnified in creation, in that God ſet him in the next degree to the Angels; <hi>Thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels;</hi> there is the firſt part of the anſwer to this queſtion, man was magnified in being made ſo excellent a creature, and in having ſo many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent creatures made for him. All which may be underſtood of man, as created in Gods image, and Lord of the world, but ſince
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:40455:332"/> the tranſgreſſion, it is peculiar to Chriſt, As the Apoſtle applies it, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 2. 6.) and to thoſe who have their bloud and dignity reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the work of redemption, which is the next part of mans exaltation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Man is magnified or made great by the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. That exalts man indeed. Man was laid low, and his honour in the duſt, notwithſtanding all that greatneſſe which he received in creation: Though Sun, and Moone, and Stars, the fiſh of the Sea, and the fowles of the ayre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were made his ſervants, and himſelfe a companion of Angels; yet by ſin he fell below all theſe priviledges, and was made a companion for Devils, a citizen of hell: Therefore the ſecond magnifying of man, was by the work of redemption. And, <hi>what was man that thou ſhouldeſt redeeme him,</hi> when he was a captive? raiſe him when he was downe, build and repaire him when he was ruin'd, when he was loſt ſeeke him, and when he was bankrupt and undone, give him a better ſtock and ſet him up againe? What was man that thou ſhouldeſt doe all this for him? How did the mercy of God magnifie his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when he gave his Son to pay their debt to his own juſtice? If man was magnified when the Sun, and Moone, and heavens were made for him; how was he magnifyed, when God was made man for him? how was he exalted, when the Son of God was humbled for him!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Man is magnified or made great in the work of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, wherein God re-ſtamps his Image upon him, in thoſe ſhining characters of holineſſe and knowledge; The firſt creation being ſpoiled, occaſion'd redemption, and redemption purchaſed a ſecond creation. <hi>Every one that is in Chriſt is a new creature,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Our dignity is far greater in being new creatures, then in being creatures.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Man is magnified by thoſe ſeverall acts of favour and grace, which God caſts upon him every day: ſmiling upon him, embracing him in his armes, admitting him to neere communion with himſelfe, watching over him, tending him, guarding him with Angels, directing him, counſelling him, comforting him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him by his ſpirit, till he bring him unto glory, which is the higheſt ſtep of preferment that mans nature is capable of. What is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him in all theſe things? Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve hence; firſt, That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All the worth and dignity of man, is out of himſelfe. What</hi>
                     <pb n="653" facs="tcp:40455:332"/> 
                     <hi>is man?</hi> As if he had ſaid, man hath nothing of his own, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to, or to ingratiate himſelf with God. God hath put ſomething upon him, he hath magnified man, and given him a reall worth, becauſe he would. Free grace exalts man. Hence <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 90. 20.) the Pſalmiſt prayes, <hi>Let the heathen know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be but men:</hi> As if he had ſaid, man, who is high in his own eſteeme, conceits himſelfe to be ſomewhat above man, he judges of himſelfe beyound his own ſphere and border: Therefore Lord bring their thoughts within the compaſſe of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>let them know that they are but men;</hi> A man that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with himſelfe, will be humble enough; <hi>A meere man, is but meere earth.</hi> The Prophet tells him ſo, thrice over, with one breath <hi>(Jer.</hi> 22. 29.) <hi>O earth, earth, earth, heare the word of the Lord.</hi> Man is earth, in the conſtitution of his body, that was framed out of the earth: he is earthly in the corruption of his mind, that muds in the earth: The Apoſtles ſtile is, <hi>earthly minded men:</hi> And he will be earth, in his diſſolution; when he dies he returnes <hi>to his earth.</hi> A naturall man is earth all over; earth in his making, earthly in his mind, his ſpirit earthly, earth gets into this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his upper regions: and the body, his lower region, ſhall moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to earth againe: Then, <hi>what is man?</hi> Hence (I ſay) it is, that when man at any time would exalt and lift himſelf up, he thinks himſelfe above man, he hath ſome notion or apprehenſion of an excellency, beyound the line of a creature: He conceits he hath or is a peece of a deity. The firſt ground of hope upon which man raiſed himſelfe againſt God, was, that he might be a god; he was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in being made like unto God, he would be <hi>(which was the higheſt robbery)</hi> Gods equall, and ſtand by himſelfe: this thought was his fall. There is ſuch a principle of pride in the hearts of all men by nature. They are not contented in the ſpheare of a creature, they would be ſomewhat, beyound that. The truth is, all the true worth and dignity of man, is in what he hath beyound himſelfe, his excellency is in Chriſt, and his glory, in being made partaker of the divine nature. It abaſed man, when he aſpired to take a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to himſelfe, but it exalts man, when God inſpires him with a participation of the divine nature. <hi>What is man that thou doeſt thus magnifie him?</hi> Chriſt makes us very great and glorious, by the dignity which he puts upon us: as he tells the Church <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 16. 14.) <hi>Thy beauty was perfect, through my comelineſſe which I had put upon thee;</hi> thou hadſt no comelineſſe, no beauty of thine own,
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:40455:333"/> but thorough my comelineſſe thou art very beautifull. The worth of man is out of himſelfe; the Church ſhines by thoſe rayes, by that luſtre, which Chriſt caſts upon her.</p>
                  <p>Secondly obſerve from this queſtion, <hi>What is man, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man hath layed himſelfe ſo low, that he is not worthy of one thought from God. What is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him and ſet thy heart upon him?</hi> It is a wonder that God ſhould vouchſafe a gracious looke upon ſuch a creature as man; it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, conſidering the diſtance between God and man, as man is a creature, and God the creatour; <hi>What is man:</hi> that God ſhould take notice of him? is he not a clod of earth, a peece of clay? but conſider him as a ſinfull and an uncleane creature, and we may wonder to amazement; what is an uncleane creature, that God ſhould magnifie him? will the Lord indeed put value upon filthines, and fix his approving eye upon an impure thing? One ſtep further, what is rebellious man, man an enemy to God, that God ſhould magnifie him! what admiration can anſwer this queſtion? will God prefer his enemies, and magnifie thoſe who would caſt him downe? Will a Prince exalt a traytor, or give him honour, who attempts to take away his life? The ſinfull nature of man, is an enemy to the nature of God, and would pull God out of Heaven; yet God even at that time, is raiſing man to Heaven; <hi>Sinne would leſſen the great God, and yet God greatens ſinfull man.</hi> Thirdly obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Though man be low in himſelfe, yet God beſtows many thoughts and cares upon him.</hi> Though there be no reaſon at all in man, why God ſhould magnifie him, yet God doth and will. Free grace overlooks all the diſtance that is between God and us, as we are creatures, and it overlooks that greater and vaſter diſtance, which is between God and us, as we are ſinfull creatures; Many a man is ready to think himſelfe ſo good and ſo great, that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not worthy one of his thoughts, or a caſt of his eye; he thinks it too much to looke towards a man, that is of the ſame make with himſelfe, becauſe he is a little lower ſtatur'd in eſtate or degree. A great rich man thinks he doth a poore man a very great favour, if he turns about and ſpeaks to him: We may well cry out with admiration, O the pride of man to man! and O the love of God to man! one man hath ſcarce humility enough to ſpeake to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, who in nature is equall to him, and yet God (who is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above us) hath love enough to magnifie and ſet his heart upon him.</p>
                  <pb n="655" facs="tcp:40455:333"/>
                  <p> The language of the holy Ghoſt, is very graduall about this point.</p>
                  <p>Eirſt, <hi>What is man that thou art mindfull of him? and the ſonne of man, that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> Pſal. 8. 4. To be mindfull of a man, is not ſo much as to viſit him, we may be mindfull of thoſe, whom we goe not to ſee, or to whom we ſend no helpe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>What is man that thou takeſt knowledge of him, or the ſonne of man, that thou makest an account of him,</hi> Pſal. 144. 3. It is much that God will take knowledge of a man, or caſt an eye upon him, but it is a great deale more, that God will make account of him; but the third and higheſt ſtep of favour, is this of the text, that the Lord will magnifie man and ſet his heart upon him, as if he could not be without him? Obſerve, Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The true apprehenſion of the greatneſſe of Gods mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us, makes us little in our owne eyes.</hi> I ground it thus, when <hi>Job</hi> had conſidered how the Lord exalts and greatens man, he then abaſes and diminiſhes man, <hi>what is man that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt magnifie him?</hi> Nothing ſhould draw man ſo low in himſelf, as to thinke how high God doth, and how much higher, yet, God intends to raiſe him. In the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 16. When <hi>David</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of God by <hi>Nathan,</hi> whether he ſhould build him an houſe? God anſwered no, he ſhould not, but his ſonne after him ſhould; But though the Lord would not have <hi>David</hi> build him an houſe, yet the Meſſenger, who was to carry this report, muſt tell <hi>David, That the Lord would build him an houſe, and eſtabliſh his ſonne upon the throne after him,</hi> verſ. 10. 11. Aſſoon as <hi>David</hi> had this anſwer brought him, of Gods wonderfull goodneſſe toward him, and of thoſe large promiſes to his family, he breaks out into this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive admiration, <hi>Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto? And yet this is a ſmall thing in thine eyes, O God: for thou haſt alſo ſpoke of thy ſervants houſe for a great while to come, and haſt regarded me according to the eſtate of a man of high degree, O Lord God.</hi> We hear not of ſuch an humble ſpeech falling from <hi>Davids</hi> lips, till Gon ſent him that meſſage of advancement. And ſo (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 8.) when <hi>David</hi> out of that aboundant love he bare to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> enquired, <hi>Is there any that is left of the houſe of Saul, that I may ſhew him kindneſſe for Jonathans ſake? Mephiboſheth</hi> was found; And when <hi>David</hi> told him, I will take care for thee, <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi>
                     <pb n="656" facs="tcp:40455:334"/> 
                     <hi>eat bread at my table continually;</hi> This favour aſtoniſheth <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth, what is thy ſevant, that thou ſhouldeſt looke upon ſuch a dead dogg, as I am?</hi> He ſpake of himſelfe below men, when he heard <hi>David</hi> ſpeake ſo highly of him. A living dogg is better then a dead Lion; but what is worſe then a dead dogg? The like impreſſion <hi>Davids</hi> exceſſive kindneſſe made upon the ſpirit of <hi>Abigail</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 41.) when he ſent meſſengers to her, after the death of her husband <hi>Nabal,</hi> to aſſure her, that he would be her husband. This honour (that <hi>David</hi> annointed King over Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhould deſire her to be his wife) abaſes <hi>Abigail</hi> in her own eyes, <hi>Let me</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>be a ſervant to waſh the feet of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of my Lord. Davids</hi> wife! (ſaid ſhe) it is too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment for me, to be <hi>Davids</hi> ſervant! I ſhall be honour'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be his ſervants ſervant, and that in the loweſt ſervice, to waſh their feet. As ingenuous ſpirits, when they heare meſſages of great favours tender'd them, fall low in their own thoughts: So much more will gracious ſpirits. Thoſe magnifying offers of Chriſt and pardon of ſin by him, of a crowne of life, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weight of glory purchas'd by him; theſe magnifying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (I ſay) bring the ſoule upon the knee, upon the meditation and acknowledgement of it's owne meanneſſe and vileneſſe; <hi>What am I that the Lord ſhould reſpect me, that the Lord ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme me, that he ſhould regenerate me, than he ſhould ſet his love upon me, prepare heaven and glory, a crowne and a kingdome for me? what am I? There is nothing doth more emptie us of ſelf-conceit and high thoughts, than duly to conſider, what high thoughts God hath of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note one thing further from theſe words, <hi>what is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If God magnifie man, one man ſhould not vilifie and debaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; one man ſhould not contemne and ſlight another. Who art thou that centemneſt thy brother?</hi> Thou canſt not (really) magnifie thy brother, and wilt thou debaſe him? It is a moſt dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to abaſe thoſe, whom God magnifies, to deſpiſe thoſe whom God honours. That, on whom God ſets his heart, againſt him, man ſhould ſet his heart, or tongue, or pen. God ſeekes occaſion to magnifie us, though we give him advantages every day to caſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour upon us. Let man takc heed how he diſhonours thoſe, whom the great God now doth, and intends to honour more. When <hi>Pharoah</hi> magnified <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he cauſed the people to cry <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brech,</hi>
                     <pb n="657" facs="tcp:40455:334"/> that is, <hi>bow the knee before him, Gen.</hi> 41. 43. And when <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> intended to advance <hi>Mordecai.</hi> He commanded him to be arrayed in royall aparrell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and proclamation to be made, <hi>Thus ſhall it be done to the man, whom the King delighteth to honour,</hi> Eſth. 6. 11. Princes expect that al ſhould favour and honour, thoſe, whom they honour and make their favourites. Surely then the great God will not beare it, that they ſhould be deſpiſed, whom he delights in, and caſts honour upon.</p>
                  <p>But here a Queſtion ariſes, How this is appliable unto <hi>Job?</hi> why doth <hi>Job,</hi> who lay upon a dung-hill, and was caſt into ſo low a condition, ſpeake of <hi>magnifying?</hi> Was <hi>Job</hi> magnified? Doth <hi>Job</hi> wonder at his preferment and exaltation, when he was brought downe to the duſt? Poore <hi>Job!</hi> Thou waſt almoſt nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and made no body, and doſt thou ſpeake, as if thy honour were too big for thee, <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him?</hi> We may anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By connecting this word <hi>[magnifie]</hi> with the words that follow; <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him, and that thou ſhouldeſt ſet thine heart upon him?</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him, by ſetting thine heart upon him?</hi> And ſo, ſetting the heart upon man, is an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what is meant by magnifying man. And that's a cleare truth; when God ſets his heart upon a man, he magnifies him ſure enough; that act of God is the exaltation of the creature: Man needs no greater honour then this, that God ſets his heart upon him; he that knows that, knows himſelf high enough. Whatſoever man ſets his heart upon, he (as man can) exalts and magnifies it. If a man ſets his heart upon another man, he magnifies that man. Yea, if a man ſets his heart upon a beaſt or a ſtoue, (he in a ſence) dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that beaſt, that ſtone. If he ſets his heart upon any creature, he makes that creature a god to him: for nothing ſhould have the heart, but God alone. And the reaſon is, becauſe ſetting the heart upon any thing is the higheſt exaltation we can give it. Therefore nothing ought to have the heart ſet upon it, but God; for he is Lord over all. And the Lord cals us to ſet our hearts upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is the higheſt honour, creatures can give him. Now, as our ſetting our hearts on God magnifies him, ſo the ſetting of his heart on us, doth wonderfully magnifie us. And he therefore ſets his heart upon us, that we might at once ſee and admire, how much he honours us. If a King ſet his heart upon a man, that man
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:40455:335"/> is greatly magnified; he is magnified in the opinion of others; and not only in the bare opinion of others, but there is a real dignity put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that man, on whom a King puts his heart. How much more, if God ſets his heart upon man, is man really magnified. That God ſets his eye upon a man, is a magnifying of him. It was the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, that the Lord promiſed his eye would be upon that place; and it was a high honour to the Temple, that God would looke upon it continually, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 29. If it be a condeſcenſion for God to eye the creature, <hi>He humbleth himſelfe to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth,</hi> Pſa. 113. 6. How great is his condeſcention in ſetting his heart upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So there is a truth in this ſence, and we may make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable improvement of it, <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him, by ſetting thine heart upon him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> may have reſpect to his former greatneſſe, when God magnified him, and made him the greateſt man in the Eaſt; and is now be-moaning his owne change, in the changeableneſſe of mans condition; who, when he is lifted up to the higheſt, fairly built and adorned, yet in a moment may be caſt downe and <note place="margin">Quorſum in me lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Therefore <hi>Job</hi> comes with his wonder, <hi>Lord, what is man!</hi> What is the ordinary ſtate of man, that thou ſhouldeſt take care to make him great! As if he had ſaid, why didſt thou magnifie me, to make me the greateſt man in the Eaſt? Why didſt thou ſet thine heart upon me, to bleſſe my family, and provide for me, as if thou hadſt none elſe to provide for? Thou ſeeſt mans beauty is blaſted in the twinckling of an eye, and then all thy worke is loſt. <hi>It is not worth the while to doe that, which may be undone ſo ſoone.</hi> Would any one be at coſt to build a houſe, to beſtow a great deale of charge &amp; pains upon it, and it may be ſpend ſome yeares about the adorning and furniſhing of it; and when all's done, it is ſuch a houſe, that the next breath of wind may le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell with the ground. What is ſuch a houſe, that a man ſhould build it? When man is raiſed up and built, a puffe of wind, a blaſt of affliction blowes him downe, and brings him to the duſt; what is this man, that he ſhould be magnified? This is a good ſence of the words; that <hi>Job</hi> reflecting upon his former greatneſſe, and honour, now defaced and overthrowne, breakes out into this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation; what is man? Why ſhould God in his providence lay out ſo much to magnifie and ſet a man up; who may be ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down, as you ſee I am at this day.</p>
                  <pb n="659" facs="tcp:40455:335"/>
                  <p> But thirdly, rather take it thus. <hi>What is man that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt magnifie him?</hi> Namely, by dealing with him thus in chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and afflictions by diſciplining and tutoring him with the rods of thy correction.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, Is it a magnifying of a man to afflict a man?</p>
                  <p>Yes, it is a magnifying of man; man is magnified two wayes, by affliction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that, God, who is ſo great will diſcend to chaſtiſe and correct, or to order the Chaſtiſements and corrections of man. Man is magnified, when God deales or contends with him. That, <note place="margin">Indignus ſum, quem vel percu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior ſum quam ut adverſus me manum exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</note> God wraſtles and ſtrives with man, is an honour to man. <hi>David</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14.) ſeemes to looke upon it, as too great honour (though it were a burdenſome one) that <hi>Saul,</hi> a King, one ſo much above him, would follow and purſue him, <hi>Againſt whom is the King of Iſrael come out? against a dead dog, or against a flea?</hi> Alas, I am no match for thee, thou putteſt too much weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, in that thou contendeſt with me. To make great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to ſend out a great army and skifull Commanders againſt an enemie, magnifies that enemy, that is, it begets an apinion, that ſurely he is ſome great and potent enemy, againſt whom ſuch great preparations are made. In this ſenſe you may underſtand it, that affliction is a magnifying of a man, becauſe the great God comes forth to battle againſt <hi>him, who</hi> is but duſt and aſhes, but as a dead dogg, or a flea. The Heathens had ſuch a notion, they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">

And another, <hi>To die by the arme of Hercules, amighty favour, and alwaies to be remembred.</hi> Some kind of trouble is an honour, as well as a trouble: The magnifying of man, as well as an afflicting of him. Man is ſo farre from deſerving any favour from God, that, as a creature, he is not worthy a blow, though, as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he is moſt worthy of death from God.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, we may anſwer it, that man is (not only thus notionally, but) really magnified by afflictions, and that two waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in this life; the very humblings of the Saints are their exaltations: their afflictions are their glory. There was never any ſo
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:40455:336"/> famous for greatneſſe, for riches, for honours, as ſome have been for ſufferings. Who is there upon record throughout the whole booke of God? who is there in any hiſtorie of the world ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for greatneſſe and riches and high atchievements, as <hi>Job</hi> a ſufferer? All the victories of <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> yea of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> have not render'd them ſo famous to poſterity, as the conflicts of <hi>Job.</hi> His affiictions have magnified him more, then all his other greatneſſe, or then the greatneſſe of other men hath mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified them. If <hi>Job</hi> had only been the richeſt man in the Eaſt, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we ſhould never have had a word of any of his acts, or ſo much as mention of his name in Scripture. That which gave him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have a whole booke written of him alone by the pen of the holy Ghoſt, beſides the often mention of his precious name in other books, is this, that he endured ſo much. <hi>That man is magnified really, who is thus afflicted, and comes off holily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Afflictions have an influence upon the life to come. The Apoſtle is expreſſe in that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. where he exhorts, not to be troubled with our preſent afflictions, for they <hi>worke for us a farre more exceeding weight of glory.</hi> That which workes for us an exceeding weight of glory, magnifies us. It is not ſaid any where in the Scripture, that mans honours, or his riches, or his greatneſſe in the world, worke for him a farre more exceeding weight of glory: There is no ſuch thing aſcribed or atributed to outward comforts and priviledges; but our afflictions worke for us a farre more exceeding weight of glory. Not (as Papiſts abuſe that Scripture) as if afflictions did merit glory: but as the way <note place="margin">Duntaxat ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificatur, quo itinare ad glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam perveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> and courſe wherein God ſets men, and through which he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt and lift them up to greateſt glory. Glory is the purchaſe of Chriſt, and all the heavieſt ſufferings of the creature are not able to purchaſe one graine of glory, not the leaſt imaginable weight of glory, much leſſe an exceeding weight of glory; but God brings his people to glory, and makes them (as he did the Lord Chriſt) in their degree, perfect through ſufferings. Hence obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That afflictions are (if rightly improved) the exaltations and magnifyings of the Saints.</hi> The rod of diſcipline in Gods hand, becomes a ſcepter of honour in ours. This croſſes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thoughts of the world. The truth is, there is ſcarce a ſoule in the world under affliction, but he thinks himſelf abaſed by it, and ſaith, that God hath laid him low. Yet the right uſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affliction, is the beſt preferment. The Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:40455:336"/> is expreſſe, <hi>Let the brother of low degree rejoyce in that he is exalted.</hi> The low have an exaltation; yea their lowneſſe is their exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet, we are ready to have undervaluing thoughts of our ſelves, when the hand of God is upon us; when God takes away that, for which men ſet a price upon themſelves; they ſcarce thinke themſelves worth any thing. But this eſpecially reaches that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contempt of others, a man afflicted is eſteemed by moſt as a man abaſed. They who have prized a man, and had great thoughts of him, when he had a great eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let him once fall in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, though he continue the ſame in ſpirituals, yea, though he increaſes in them, and his grace ſhines, as much or more, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet he is diſ-eſteemed and laid low in their thoughts. So much for thoſe words, <hi>what it is to magnifie;</hi> and likewiſe how they may have a ſutableneſſe with <hi>Jobs</hi> condition, he being ſo afflicted and emptied, when he ſpake them.</p>
                  <q>And that thou ſhouldeſt ſet thine heart upon him.</q>
                  <p>To ſet the heart notes foure things in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Great care and intention of ſpirit, Prov. 27. 23. <hi>Be thou diligent to know the ſtate of thy flocks, and looke well to thy herds;</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>ſet thine heart upon thy herds:</hi> The heart is ſet upon the herds in providing and taking care of them, in looking to the welfare of the herds and of the flocks. <hi>Samuel</hi> uſes that language to <hi>Saul</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 20.) when he came ſeeking his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſſes, <hi>As for the aſſes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſet not thine heart upon them.</hi> that is, take no care for them, never trouble thy ſelfe more about that buſineſſe, that care is over, they are found. In this ſence God ſets his heart upon man; <hi>What is man that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſet thine heart upon him?</hi> That is, that thou ſhouldeſt take ſo much care of him, and watch over him; As the Lord ſpeakes of his vineyard (Iſa. 27. 3.) <hi>I the Lord will keepe it, leſt any hurt it, I will keepe it night and day;</hi> He ſet his heart upon the vineyard to watch it, leaſt any ſhould, touching, hurt it. God in this ſence takes ſo much care for man, that he ſeemeth (as it were) care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of all other creatures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> God doth care for Oxen: The Apoſtle having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goodneſſe of God to beaſts, providing by a law, that they ſhould not be muzled, preſently he queſtions, <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> As if he had ſaid, ſurely there is ſome what more in it, or, <hi>ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes;</hi> Not altogether, doubtleſſe
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:40455:337"/> God had regard to Oxen, <hi>But for our ſakes no doubt it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> that is, chiefly for our ſakes, <hi>That he which ploweth, ſhould plow in hope, and he that threſheth in hope, ſhould be partaker of his hope,</hi> So, when Chriſt ſpeaks of the Lillies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>If God ſo cloath the Lillies of the field, how much more will he cloath you?</hi> You ſhall have the ſtrength of his care to provide for you, to feed and cloath you. thus God ſets his heart upon man, he lookes to his people, as to his houſhold, to his charge; he will ſee, they ſhall have all things needfull for them. And ſo not laying to heart, (which is the contrary) ſignifies careleſneſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 7. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Babylon, Thou ſaidſt I ſhall be a Ladie for ever, ſo that thou didſt not lay theſe things to thy heart;</hi> that is, thou didſt not regard theſe things, to take care about them. And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 4. the expreſſion is very full, where God cals the Prophet to attention, and he calleth him all over, <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with thine eyes, and heare with thine eares, and ſet thine heart on all that I ſhall ſhew thee:</hi> He wakens the whole man; See, and ſee with thine eyes; Heare, and heare with thine eares, and ſet thine heart upon it, the ſum of all is, be thou very intentive, and diligent about this buſineſſe to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſet the heart notes an act of the affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, A man ſets his love upon what he ſets his heart; that's the meaning of <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 62. 10. <hi>If riches increaſe; ſet not your heart upon them;</hi> That is, let not your love, your affections, your deſires cloſe with theſe things: when riches abound, let not your deſires abound too. It is an admirable frame of heart to have nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſcant affections in a large plentifull eſtate, <hi>He is the true rich man, who loves his riches poorly. Set your affections on things that are above,</hi> Col. 3. 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To ſet the heart, notes high eſteeme and account, this is more than bare love and affection, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 3. when a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of warre was held by <hi>Davids</hi> Commanders, about going out to battell againſt <hi>Abſolom,</hi> they all vote againſt <hi>Davids</hi> perſon all undertaking, upon this ground, <hi>they will not care for us, they will not ſet their hearts upon us, or value us,</hi> their hearts are ſet upon thee, thou art the prize they looke for, and therefore the heate of the battell will be againſt thee. Againe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 20. When the wife of <hi>Phineas</hi> was delivered of a ſon (a ſon is the womans joy and glory, yet) the text ſaith, when the women that ſtood by, told her that a ſon was borne, <hi>ſhe anſwered not, neither did ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi>
                     <pb n="663" facs="tcp:40455:337"/> 
                     <hi>it,</hi> ſhe did not ſet her heart upon it, becauſe the glory was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In either of theſe ſences, the Lord ſets his heart upon man, he greatly loves man; The love of God to man, is the ſpring of mercy to man, yea love is the ſpring of love, love acted, ſprings from a decree of love <hi>(Deut.</hi> 7. 7.) <hi>The Lord thy God did not ſet his love upon you, &amp;c. becauſe ye were more in number then any other people, but becauſe the Lord loved you,</hi> Love alſo led in that higheſt work of mercy, the giving of Chriſt: <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſon.</hi> Joſh. 3. 16. As love is the ſpring and root of all the reall duty, which mans performes to God, and is therefore called <hi>the fulfilling of the law;</hi> Our love fulfilleth the will of God: ſo the love of God is the root of all that good we receive, his love fulfilleth our will, that is, whatſoever we will or ask according to the will of God, the love of God fulfills it for us. Our love fulfills the law of Gods command, and Gods love fulfills the law of our wants and lawfull deſires. His heart is ſet upon us, and then his hand is open to us.</p>
                  <p>Further, God doth not only love man, but his love is great, and his eſteeme of man very high; and he reallizes the greateſt love, by beſtowing the greateſt mercy: How did God ſet his heart upon us, when he gave his Son, who lay in his boſome, for us, <hi>He ſet his boſome upon us, when he gave us his Sonne, who came out of his boſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence let us ſee our duty. Should not we ſet our heart upon God, when God ſets his heart upon us? the ſoveraignty of God, cals for our hearts: He, as Lord may uſe al that we have, or are: And there is more than a law of ſoveraignty, why, we ſhould give God our hearts; God hath given us his heart firſt: he who calleth for our hearts, hath firſt given us his. What are our hearts to his heart? The love of God infinitely exceeds the love and affection of the creature. What were it to God, if he had none of our hearts? But woe to us, if we had not the heart of God. This phraſe ſhews us the reaſon why God calls for our hearts, he gves us his own; it is but equall among men, to love where we are loved, to give a heart where we have received one; how much more ſhould we love God, and give him our hearts, when we heare he loves us and ſets his heart upon us, whoſe love &amp; heart alone, is infinitely better then all the loves and hearts of all men and Angels.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a fourth conſideration about this expreſſion, the
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:40455:338"/> ſetting of the heart. Setting the heart, is applied to the anger and diſpleaſure of God; ſo the phraſe is uſed <hi>(Job</hi> 34. 14.) <hi>If he ſet his heart upon man, all fleſh ſhall periſh together:</hi> that is, if God be reſolved to chaſtiſe man, to bring judgements upon him, all fleſh ſhall periſh together; none ſhall be able to oppoſe it. As it is the highteſt favour to have God ſet his heart upon us in mercy and love, ſo it is the higheſt judgement, to have God ſet his heart upon a man in anger and in wrath, to ſet his heart to afflict and puniſh. The Lord anſwers his own people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3. that notwithſtanding all the prayers and motions of his beloved favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, in their behalfe, <hi>his heart could not be towards them:</hi> Then his heart was ſtrongly ſet againſt them, or upon them in extreame anger; therefore he concludes, <hi>they that are for the ſword, to the ſword, and they that are for destruction, to deſtruction, &amp;c.</hi> If God ſet his heart to afflict, he will afflict, and he can doe it. And there may be ſuch a ſenſe of the text here. <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt ſet thine heart upon him?</hi> that thou ſhouldeſt come ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, to conteſt and contend with man, who is but duſt and aſhes; The words following (though I adhere rather to the former inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation) carry ſomewhat toward it.</p>
                  <q>Verſe 18. <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt viſit him every morning, and try him every moment?</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here are two acts more about which the queſtion is put. <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt viſit him every morning?</hi> And <hi>what is man, that thou ſhouldeſt try him every moment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>That thou ſhouldeſt viſit him every morning?</q>
                  <p>To viſit, is taken three wayes, and they may all be applied to this <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Viſitavit in bonum &amp; in malum.</hi>
                     </note> text.</p>
                  <p>To viſit, is firſt to afflict, to chaſten, yea to puniſh; the higheſt judgements in Scripture, come under the notion of viſitations. Exod. 34. 7. <hi>Viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children;</hi> that is, puniſhing them. And in the Prophet; <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Shall not I viſit for this? ſhall not my ſoule be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi> Jer. 48. 44. when God came againſt <hi>Moab</hi> with thoſe terrible judgements, it is called <hi>the yeere of their viſitation. I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the yeere of their viſitation.</hi> And it is a common ſpeech with us, when a houſe hath the plague, which is one of the higheſt ſtroakes of temporall affliction,
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:40455:338"/> we uſe to ſay, <hi>ſuch a houſe is viſited.</hi> Then obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Afflictions are viſitations.</hi> They are called ſo, becauſe then God comes to ſearch our hearts and lives; <hi>afflictions are Gods ſearchers and examiners. Jeruſalem</hi> is threatned to be ſcearcht with candles, and that was the time of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> viſitation. To ſearch with a candle, notes the moſt accurate ſearching, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man when ſhe had loſt her groate, <hi>lighted a candle, and ſought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently till ſhe found it;</hi> ſhe viſited every hole to find it out. When you ſee the Lord afflicting, then he is viſiting, he lights a candle to ſearch every corner of your lives.</p>
                  <p>And if afflictions be Gods viſitations, it is time for man to viſit himſelfe, when he is afflicted. We ſhould viſit our ſoules, when God viſits our bodies, our eſtates, our families, or the Kingdome where we live. Woe to thoſe, who doe not viſit themſelves, when God viſits them. The Prophet calls to this duty in a time of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt viſitation, <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes,</hi> Lam. 3.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, If God in affliction viſit us, let us viſit God; let us anſwer his viſitation of us, with our viſitation of him. <hi>Lord in trouble have they viſited thee, they powred out a prayer when thy chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was upon them. Iſa.</hi> 26. 16. Would you know what the viſiting of God is? It is praying unto him, <hi>They viſited thee, they powred out a prayer when thy chaſtning was on them.</hi> We viſit Heaven in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, when we pray much in our afflictions. When God viſiteth us, let us viſit him, &amp; never give over viſiting him, til he remove his viſitation from, or ſanctifie it to us. That's the firſt ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To viſit, in a good ſence ſignifies to ſhew mercy, and to refreſh, to deliver, and to bleſſe; <hi>Ruth,</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Naomi heard how the Lord had viſited his people, and given them bread.</hi> Gen. 21. 2. <hi>The Lord viſited Sarah, and ſhe conceived, &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 3. 16. <hi>The Lord hath ſurely viſited his people,</hi> when they were upon daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of deliverance out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> That greateſt mercy and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, that ever the children of men had, is thus expreſſed, <hi>Luke,</hi> 1. 68. <hi>The Lord hath viſited and redeemed his people.</hi> Mercies are viſitations, when God comes in kindneſs and love to do us good, he viſiteth us. And theſe mercies are called viſitations, in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe God comes neer to us when he doth us good: Mercy is a drawing neere to a ſoule, a drawing neere to a place. As when God ſends a judgement, or afflicts, he is ſaid to depart and go away from that place; ſo when he doth us good, he comes neere, and as it were applies himſelf in favour to our perſons and habitations.</p>

There is no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that of love, to make a viſit: becauſe, ſuch a man is my friend, and I love him, therefore I viſit him.

                     <hi>Fvery morning.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>in the mornings.</hi> And the word here uſed for morning, is conſiderable: There is a two-fold morning, which the <hi>Jewes</hi> diſtinguiſhed exactly by their watch. One morning was that, which they accounted from an hour before Sun riſing, from the very firſt breaking of the day, till the Sun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared above the Horizon, which is about the ſpace of an hour: And the word which they uſe for it is, <hi>Shachar,</hi> which ſignifies to be darkiſh or blackiſh, becauſe that firſt morning is ſomewhat darke: And ſo the <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Latini vocant dilucuium, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi diei lucula,</hi> i. e. <hi>parva lux.</hi>

And the reaſon why they expreſſe the ſecond morning ſo, is, becauſe when the Sun is up, we may ſeeke and ſearch about our buſineſſe, or go on in our callings and affairs; The height of the day, they call the <note n="b" place="margin">

<pb n="667" facs="tcp:40455:340"/> may be here meant, though the word bears the later properly: <hi>Thou doeſt viſit him every morning:</hi> that is, as ſoone as the Sun is up, yea as ſoone as day breakes, or there is any light, thou art viſiting. Mans viſits are uſually in the afternoone: it is an extraordinary thing to viſit one in the forenoone, more extraordinary to viſit in a morning, and moſt, early in a morning. Gods viſits are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary viſits, they are viſitings in the morning, and viſitings every morning, as often as the morning returnes, ſo often doth God come to viſit: not a morning that we miſſe him.</p>
                  <p>To doe a thing <hi>every morning,</hi> notes firſt the doing of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, or ſecondly, the certaine doing of it; <hi>Thou doeſt viſit every morning,</hi> that is, as ſurely and as certain as the Sun riſeth, and the morning cometh, ſo certainly doth God viſit man. Or thirdly, it notes the ſpeed, the haſt that God makes to viſit; <hi>He vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits in the morning;</hi> that is, betimes, God delayes not untill noone, much leſſe ſtayes till it be night; but he cometh in the morning. Pſal. 46. 5. <hi>God ſhall heare her, and that right early;</hi> the Hebrew is, God ſhall heare her in the morning, betimes, ſpeedily. The late coming in to work in the vineyard, is expreſt by coming at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth houre; they came ſpeedily, who came in the morning at the firſt houre. And to ſhew that we ought not to continue in wrath, and keepe up our anger, it is ſaid, <hi>let not the Sunne goe downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your wrath,</hi> that is, do not continue all day angry, let your anger goe down ſpeedily, even before the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>In this ſence, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that God viſits man every morning, as a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hic ad conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationem &amp; generalem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet.

And as ſure as the Sun riſeth, and the morning cometh, ſo ſure God viſiteth his, with mercies, therefore his mercies are ſaid <hi>to be renewed every morning,</hi> Lam. 3. 23. or freſh every morning. Unleſſe God bring new mercies every day, the old would not ſerve: we cannot bring the mercies of one day over to another: The mercies of a former day, will not ſupport us the next, therefore they muſt come every morning, <hi>ſufficient for the day, is the evill thereof.</hi> Mat. 6. and, but ſufficient for the day, is the good thereof. As we are therefore commanded to pray e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day for our daily bread: the bread you had the laſt day, will not ſerve this day, you muſt pray for the bread of this day, and for a bleſſing upon it, that God would viſit your bread, and your ſtore
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:40455:341"/> in mercy. So if need require, God afflicts every day: And the hearts of ſome men, want as much the rod every day, as bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; they could not be without affliction every day, to keep them in order, &amp; <hi>God will be as carefull to correct his children, as to feed them.</hi> If a man be watchfull over his own wayes, and the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of God with him, there is ſeldome a day, but he may find ſome rod of affliction upon him: But, as through want of care and watchfullneſſe, we looſe the ſight of many mercies, ſo we doe of many afflictions. Though God doth not every day bring a man to his bed, and breake his bones, yet we ſeldome, if at all, paſſe a day without ſome rebuke and chaſtning. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 14. <hi>I have been chaſtned every morning,</hi> ſaith he Pſalmiſt: Our lives are full of afflictions; and it is as great a part of a Chriſtians skil, to know afflictions, as to know mercies; to know when God ſmites, as to know when he girds us; and it is our ſin to overlook afflictions, as well as to overlooke mercies.</p>

This is a good ſence of the place, the Lord viſits

                  <p>
                     <hi>Afflictions are trials.</hi> The Lord proves what grace there is in the heart, &amp; he tries what corruption there is in the heart by affliction. There are many graces in the heart of man untried, and there are ſome that cannot be tried, till God bring him to an houre of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There are many corruptions in the heart of man, which he taks no notice of, nor can, till he is afflicted; many a good ſoule would not beleeve that they had ſuch an unbeleeving heart, ſuch a proud heart, till God tried him, and then corruption diſcovered it ſelf. The reaſon why God brought his people ſuch a way about in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, was <hi>(Deut.</hi> 8. 2.) <hi>to prove them, to try them, to know what was in their heart.</hi> God knowes what is in the heart of man intuitively, and he needs not goe about; he can goe the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt way into every mans heart; he proves it only to make it known to others, and to make a man know himſelfe. They could not thinke their hearts were ſo rebellious, ſo ful of murmuring and unbeleefe, if God had not taken them about to prove and try them, thoſe forty yeares.</p>
                  <p>Proſperity and comforts are trials too: whatſoever God doth with a man, he ſome way or other tries him. Looke not only upon your afflictions as trials, your mercies alſo are tryals: God gives you them to ſee what you will doe with them; he gives riches, and honour, and credit, to ſee how men will uſe and improve them: as by afflictions, ſo by outward comforts, he tries both what grace and what corruption is in our hearts. He gives comforts, to ſee
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:40455:342"/> how we can live upon God in Chriſt, when we have the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that we may ſhew, how much we make of him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom we cannot live, when we have all things beſides him. Proſperity tries corruption, then pride and creature-confidence breake forth, which before were undiſcerned: We ſay, <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy ſhewes a man,</hi> nature when it is exalted ſhewes it ſelfe, as much as when it is vext.</p>

                     <hi>The temper and ſtate of mans heart is ſo various, that there needs new experiments of him every moment.</hi> Why doth God try us every moment? Becauſe we are one moment in one temper, and the next moment in another: The acting frame of a mans heart this houre, cannot be collected, from the frame it was in, an houre before; therefore there is a continuall triall. Some things if they be tried once, they are tried for ever; if we try gold, it will ever be as good as we found it, unleſſe we alter it: as we try it to be, ſo it continues to be; But try the heart of man this day, and come againe the next, and you may find it in a different condition; to day beleeving, to morrow unbeleeving; to day humble, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row proud; to day meeke, to morrow paſſionate; to day lively and enlarged, to morrow dead and ſtraightned: pure gold to day, and to morrow exceeding droſſie. As it is with the pulſe of a ſick man, it varieth every quarter of an houre, therefore the Phyſitian tries his pulſe every time he comes, becauſe his diſeaſe alters the ſtate of his body: ſo it is with the diſtempered condition of mans ſpirit, God having tried our pulſe, the ſtate of our ſpirit, by croſſes, or by mercies this day, next day he tryes us too, and the third day he tryes us againe, and ſo keepe us in continuall trials, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are in continuall variations: That ſickneſſe, and diſeaſe within us, alters the ſtate and condition of the ſoule every moment, Our comfort is, that God hath a time wherein he will ſet our ſouls up in ſuch a frame, as he ſhall need to try us but that once. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet us up in a frame of glory, he ſhall not need to try our hearts for us, or to put us to the triall of our ſelvs any more, we ſhall ſtand, as he ſets us up to all eternity.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Lord can make his owne preſence grievous to his own ſervants. In his preſence, there is fullneſſe of joy, and at his right hand, there are pleaſures for evermore (Pſal.</hi> 16.) Yet he can make his preſence to be the fullneſſe of ſorrow, and give us paines with his right hand. As he can be to his people like a Sun to warme and comfort them, ſo like a fire to conſume and burne them, as like a ſhield to defend, ſo like a ſword to wound them. The Lord is a Sunne and a ſhield <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 84: 11.) yea, and he is ſometime as a fire, and a ſword, even to thoſe, who walke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly. <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fearfullneſſe hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd the hypocrites. Who among us ſhall dwell with devouring fire; who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings;</hi> That is, who ſhall be able to beare the diſpleaſed preſence of God, which makes him to ſinners, as a devouring fire, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 14. And thus the Saints in <hi>Sion</hi> are ſometimes afraid, and fearfullneſſe ſurprizes the upright in heart: Even they cry out, how ſhall we dwell with this devouring fire, with this everlaſting burning? They eſpecially who have ſleighted the preſence of God, may quickly feele the burden of it. Not only doe they ſo, who ſay formally and in plain termes, <hi>depart from us;</hi> but they alſo doe it, in a great meaſure, who doe not prize the preſence of God, who doe not welcome and entertaine him, in all his approaches to them. If a friend come to your houſe, and you will not looke upon him, or ſpeake to him, you bid him be gone, and your ſilence interprets his non-acceptance with you. Then take heed of neglecting the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſanctifying preſence of God, leaſt you fall ſpeedily into his afflicting preſence.

So I may ſay, be yee not ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or ſtrugglers with God, for your bands are made ſtrong. It is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 25, 26. That the Lord met <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>Inne, and ſought to kill him.</hi> The Lord is never <hi>to ſeeke</hi> to doe what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but thus he ſpeakes after the manner of men, who offer or aſſay at any buſineſſe, <hi>They ſeeke to do it.</hi> But <hi>Zipporah</hi> having circumciſed her ſonne, <hi>He let Moſes goe,</hi> It is this word, <hi>He</hi>

                     <hi>ſlacked or looſened,</hi> having before, as it were arreſted and atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him, or clapt him in priſon for making that great default, the neglect of Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we find the Lord himſelf ſpeaking, as if he were at the mercy, or under the power of man, and therefore calling (in this word) to be looſened or let alone, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Let me alone that I may deſtroy them.</hi> The prayer of faith is as a band upon Gods hand, holding him ſo faſt, that he ſeems, as one that cannot ſtrike or deſtroy, till a <hi>Moſes</hi> will give him leave, by ceaſing to pray unto him. To be ſure we are at Gods mercy, and under his power ſo, that nothing but the prayer of faith can looſen us. And therefore <hi>Job</hi> doth not attempt to break the cords, or cut them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, nor ſeeks he to untie their knots, but deſires God himſelf to do it, let me alone, looſen me: I will be a priſoner, till thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneſt the door for my deliverance.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Jephtahs</hi> daughter ſaid to him, (Judg. 11. 37.) when he had bound himſelf and her, in the bands of a raſh vow, <hi>Let me alone for two months,</hi> or looſen me from the ingagement of my vow for two months, as if ſhe had ſaid, I will not looſe my ſelf by a wilful refuſal, but, doe thou give me a willing diſpenſation. So a godly man beſpeaks the Lord in his ſtraights, <hi>Looſen me Lord.</hi> Unleſſe God be pleaſed to looſen him, he will be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and (when in a good frame of heart, and freeneſs of ſpirit) well-pleaſed with his bands. In ſome ſence he ſpeakes, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> when they were in priſon <hi>(Acts</hi> 16. 37.) <hi>Let the Lord himſelf come and fetch us out.</hi> That is, let us ſee ſuch means of our inlargement and freedome from trouble, as may aſſure us, that the Lord hath looſened and enlarged us. <hi>A godly man had a thouſand times rather be put into a priſon by God, than put himſelf into a paradice.</hi> He had rather be bound by Gods hand, than looſened by his own. That place toucht before, may reach this ſence (Prov. 24. 10.) <hi>if thou fainteſt</hi> (ſo we) or looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thy ſelf in the day of adverſity, <hi>Thy ſtrength is ſmall;</hi> that is, the ſtrengh of thy faith and patience is ſmall. There is nothing diſcovers our weakneſs more than ſtriving to break the cords of our afflictions. The ſtronger we are in faith, in love, in humility, the more quietly we lie bound. Faith ſeeks eaſe and releaſe onely in God: to ſay Lord looſen me, is a duty, to looſen our ſelves, is both our ſin and our puniſhment.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond proverbial underſtanding of the word, is, that they <note place="margin">Elegans prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bialis loquutio ad denotandum diligentem in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium intuitum quo minim as in alio diſcernet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones.

                  <q>I have ſinned.</q>
                  <p>But is this a ſufficient confeſſion? What! to ſay only in general, <hi>I have ſinned.</hi> Did not hard-hearted <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (Ezod. 9. 25)
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:40455:346"/> Falſe-hearted <hi>Saul</hi> (1 Sam 15. 24.) and Traitor-Judas) Matth. 27. 4.) make as good a confeſſion as this. Every one of theſe ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> and what doth <hi>Job</hi> ſay more? It is ſurely no great coſt nor pain to ſinful nature, to bring up ſuch a confeſſion as this.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, a general confeſſion may be a ſound confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; It is one thing not to expreſs particular ſins, with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe ſins, and another thing purpoſely to conceale them. I grant, <hi>implicit confeſſion may be as dangerous as impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit faith.</hi> And to digg in the earth, and hide our ſins in the Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin of our excuſes, is worſe than to hide our Talents in the Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin of our idleneſs. And as it is moſt dangerous, knowingly to conceale ſin from God, ſo it is very dangerous to do it through ignorance or inadvertency; Some confeſs ſin in general termes only, becauſe they know not what their ſins are, or have quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got them; As <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> called the Aſtrologers, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, and Chaldeans, and told them he had dreamed a dreame, but he could not tell what it was, <hi>For the thing was gone from him,</hi> Dan. 2. 5. Some ſuch there are, who can, or, will only ſay, <hi>They have ſinned, they have ſinned;</hi> but what, they cannot tell, or they doe not remember, <hi>Thoſe things are gone from them.</hi> That which is written of the learned <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a great Cardinal, and a Champion for <hi>Auricular, particular Confeſſion of ſinne to man,</hi> ſeemes very ſtrange, That when he lay upon his death-bed, and the Prieſt after the Popiſh manner, came to abſolve him, he had nothing to confeſs: at laſt he thought of ſome ſleight extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of his youth, which was all he had to ſay of his owne miſcarriages: We ſee a man may de a Schollar in all the knowledg of the world, of nature, and of Scripture, and yet not know his own heart, nor be ſtudied or read in himſelf. He that is ſo, in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual notion, can never want particular matter in his moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent daies to confeſſe before the Lord, and to ſhame himſelfe for. What though he hath eſcaped the pollutions of the world, and is cleanſed from the filthineſs of the fleſh? yet he knowes that ſtill in his fleſh there dwels no good thing, and that in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, there are, at leaſt touches of, many ſpiritual filthineſſes, as pride, unbelief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſides his great deficiencies in every duty, and in his love to Jeſus Chriſt, which is the ground of all. So then, in any of theſe ſences, to confeſſe ſin only in general, is a ſinful confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And yet <hi>Job</hi> made a holy confeſſion here, and ſo did the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:40455:347"/> 
                     <hi>(Luk.</hi> 18.) when he ſmote his breaſt and ſaid onely thus, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For ſecondly, though to ſpeak a general confeſſion be an eaſie matter, and every mans work; yet to make a general confeſſion, is a hard matter, a work beyond man. As no man (in a ſpiritual ſence) can ſay, <hi>Ieſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> (1 Cor. 12. 3.) ſo no man can ſay (in a Holy manner) <hi>I have ſinned, but by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> Good and bad, beleevers and unbeleevers, ſpeak often the ſame good words, but they cannot ſpeak the ſame things, nor from the ſame principles; nature ſpeaks in the one, in the other, grace. The one may ſay, very paſſionately, he hath ſinned, and ſometimes almoſt drown his words in tears, but the other ſaith, repentingly, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> and floods his heart with Godly ſorrowes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to clear it yet more, the general confeſſion of the Saints, have theſe four things in them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Beſides the fact, they acknowledge the blot, that there is much defilement and blackneſs in every ſin; that it is the onely pollution and abaſement of the creature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They confeſs the fault, that, they have done very ill in what they have done, and very fooliſhly, even like a beaſt that hath no underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They confeſs a guilt contracted by what they have done, that their perſons might be laid lyable to the ſentence of the law for every ſuch act, if Chriſt had not taken away the curſe and condemning power of it. Confeſſion of ſin (in the ſtrict nature of it) puts us into the hand of juſtice; though through the grace of the new Covenant, it puts us into the hand of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Hence the Saints confeſs all the puniſhments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Book of God to be due to ſin; and are ready to acquit God, whatſoever he hath awarded againſt ſinners: <hi>O Lord righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of face, as at this day, to the men of Iudah, and to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem,</hi> Dan. 9. 7.</p>
                  <p>And, as in this confeſſion, for the matter, they acknowledge, the blot, the fault, the guilt, the puniſhment of ſin: ſo for the manner (which ſets the difference yet wider between the general confeſſions of wicked and Godly men) they confeſs;</p>
                  <p>Firſt freely; Acknowledgements of ſin are not extorted by the pain and trouble which ſeazeth on them, as in <hi>Pharaoh, Saul</hi> and
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:40455:347"/> 
                     <hi>Judas.</hi> But when God gives them beſt dayes, they are ready to ſpeak worſt of themſelves: And when they receive moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from God, then God receives moſt and deepeſt acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin from them. They are never ſo humbled in the ſight of ſin, as when they are moſt exalted in ſeeing the ſalvations of the Lord. The goodneſs of God leads them to this repentance, they are not driven to it, by wrath and thunder.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they confeſs, feelingly; when they ſay they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they know what they ſay. They taſte the bitterneſs of ſin, and groan under the burdenſomeneſs of it, as it paſſes out in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. A natural mans confeſſions run through him, as water through a pipe, which leaves no impreſſion or ſent there, nor do they (upon the matter) any more taſte what ſin is, then the pipe doth of what reliſh water is. Or if a natural man feels any thing in confeſſion, it is the evil of puniſhment feared, not the evil of his ſin committed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they confeſs ſincerely; they mean what they ſay, &amp; are in earneſt both with God and their own Souls. <hi>Bleſſed is the man in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile, Pſal.</hi> 32. 2. The natural man caſts out his ſins by confeſſion, as Sea-men caſt their goods over-board in a ſtorm, which in the calm they wiſh for again. They ſo caſt out the evil ſpirit, that they are content to receive him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when he returns, though it be with ſeven worſe then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Even while they confeſs ſin with their lips, they keep it, like a ſweet bit, under their tongues: And wiſh it well enough, while they ſpeak it very ill.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they confeſs beleevingly; while they have an eye of ſorrow upon ſin, they have an eye of Faith upon Chriſt: <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaid he had ſinned in betraying innocent blood <hi>(Mat.</hi> 27. 4.) but inſtead of waſhing in that blood, he defiles himſelf with his own, he goes away and hangs himſelf. No wicked man in the world (continuing in that ſtate) did ever mix Faith with his ſorrowes, or beleeving, with confeſſing, he had ſinned. So much for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the words, and the ſence of this general confeſſion. Hence obſerve, firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>While a Godly man maintains his innocency, and juſtifies himſelf before men, he willingly acknowledges his infirmity, and judges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before God. Iob</hi> had ſpent much time in wiping off the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions caſt upon him by his friends, but he charges himſelf with his failings in the ſight of God. Secondly obſerve,</p>
                  <pb n="682" facs="tcp:40455:348"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>God ſpeakes better of his ſervants then they doe of themſelves.</hi> When God ſpeakes of <hi>Job,</hi> we find not one blot in all his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, all is commendation, nothing of reproof. He ſaith <hi>(c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 21.) <hi>in all this Job ſinned not:</hi> but for all that, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have ſinned:</hi> A hypocrite hath good thoughts of himſelf, and ſpeakes himſelf faire; <hi>He flatters himſelf in his own eyes, until his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be found to be hateful,</hi> Pſal. 36. 2. A godly man thinks and ſpeaks low of himſelf, he accuſes himſelf in his own eyes, though his integrity be found very acceptable with the Lord. Thirdly obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The holieſt man on earth, hath cauſe to confeſs that he hath ſinned.</hi> Confeſſion is the duty of the beſt Chriſtians. Firſt, The higheſt form of believers in this life, is not above the actings of ſin; though the loweſt of believers, is not under the power of it. And if the line of ſinning be as long as the line of living, then the line of confeſſing muſt be of the ſame length with both. While the Ship leaks, the pump muſt not ſtand ſtill. And ſo long as we gather ill humors, there will be need of vomits and purgings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Confeſſion is a ſoul-humbling duty, and the beſt have need of that, for they are in moſt danger of being lifted up above meaſure. To preſerve us from thoſe ſelf-exaltations, the Lord ſometimes ſends the Meſſenger of Satan to buffet us by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and commands us to buffet our ſelves often by confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Confeſſion affects the heart with ſin, and ingages the heart againſt it. Every confeſſion of the evill we do, is a new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation not to do it any more. The beſt in their worſt part, have ſo much freedome to ſin, that they have need enough to be bound from it in variety of bonds.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Confeſſion of ſin, ſhews us more clearly our need of mercy, and indears it more to us. How good and ſweet is mercy to a ſoul, that hath taſted, how evil, and how bitter a thing it is to ſin againſt the Lord. How welcome, how beautiful is a pardon, when we have been viewing the uglineſs of our own guilt?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Confeſſion of ſin, advances Chriſt in our hearts. How doth it declare the riches of Chriſt, when we are not afraid to tell him, what infinite ſums of debt we are in, which he onely, and he eaſily can diſcharge? how doth it commend the healing vertue of his blood, when we open to him ſuch mortal wounds and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which he only, and he eaſily can cure? Wo be to thoſe who commit ſin abundantly, that grace may abound; but it is our duty
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:40455:348"/> to confeſſe ſinne aboundantly, that grace may abound.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Though we need not confeſſe ſin at all to informe God: he knowes our ſins, though we will not make them known; and hath an eye to ſee, though we ſhould not have a tongue to confes. Though (I ſay) we confeſſe not to informe God what we are, or what we have done, yet, we muſt confeſſe to glorifie God. While we ſhame our ſelves, we honour him. <hi>My ſonne</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Achan.</hi> c. 7. v. 19) <hi>give I pray thee glory to the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; and make confeſſion unto him:</hi> Every attribute of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives this gift of glory by mans confeſſion. Juſtice is glorified, and mercy is glorified, patience is glorified, and holineſſe is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Holineſſe is glorified in oppoſing ſin, and patience in ſparing the ſinner; mercy is glorified in pardoning ſin, and juſtice in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfaction at the hand of Chriſt for the pardon of it. Fourthly obſerve.</p>

                     <hi>Holy confeſſion of ſin, leades the way to gratious pardoning of ſin, Job</hi> begins the next verſe with a vehement prayer for pardon. <hi>And why doeſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſſion, and take away mine iniquity.</hi> Sin concealed and kept cloſe, growes upon us: And it growes three wayes; Firſt, in the ſtrength of it; Secondly, in the guilt of it; Thirdly, in the terrour and vexation of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3, 4. <hi>When I kept ſilence, my bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long.</hi> Confeſſion is a meanes to obtaine the abatement of ſin, in all three.

I ſhall now handle them, as they are a conceſſion or a grant that he had ſinned; and ſo the ſence may be given thus: I <hi>have ſinned. what ſhall I doe unto thee?</hi> As if he had ſaid; <hi>Let it be granted, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that I have ſinned, and ſinned as deepely as my friends have charged me; ſup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>The later words plainly import a queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee?</hi> But the ſence of the queſtion is not ſo plaine: The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion may be taken two wayes: Either affirmatively, or negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

                  <p n="1">1. Working with great willingneſſe and readineſſe of mind; and hence it is applied to the workings of ſin in naturall men, who work with the greateſt freedome that can be. Man ſins naturally, and therefore freely: he is carried on with a full ſwing, with tide and wind he ſins, nothing in himſelf contradicting or giving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vote: He is a true worker of iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 5.</p>

                  <p>The word being taken in this height of ſence, &amp; the queſtion for an affirmation, <hi>What ſhall I doe?</hi> that is, ſhew me, direct me what to do; we may obſerve from it, Firſt, That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What to do in caſe of ſin, is a point of the higheſt conſideration, I have ſinned, what ſhall I do?</hi> If ever we have need to go and aske counſell, to ſit down and debate the mater with our ſevles or others, it is, when we have ſinned. Such is the nature of ſin, and ſuch the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that it calls us to higheſt conſideration what to do about it. Matters of great conſequence, are matters of great conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Sin hath an influence upon an eternity. If any thing be more worthy your thoughts then that, let it have them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Look upon the queſtion as following <hi>Jobs</hi> confeſſion: Obſerve thence,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ſincere confeſſion of ſin, makes the ſoule very active and inquiſitive about the remedies of ſin. I have ſinned;</hi> the very next word is, <hi>What ſhall I doe?</hi> Many make confeſſion of ſin, who are never troubled about the cure and redreſſe of ſin; <hi>Lord what ſhall I doe?</hi> is not the next queſtion to, <hi>Lord, I have ſinned.</hi> Nay, it may be the next action is, to ſin over the ſame ſin, they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. As ſoon as thoſe <hi>Jewes</hi> heard of the fouleneſſe of their ſin in crucifying Chriſt, and of the ſadneſſe of their condition; their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is like this of <hi>Job, what ſhall we doe? what ſhall we doe that we may be ſaved?</hi> As Chriſt ſpeakes to the woman of <hi>Samaria (Job.</hi> 4. 10.) when he offered her the water of life, <hi>If thou didſt</hi>
                     <pb n="685" facs="tcp:40455:349"/> 
                     <hi>know the gift of God, and who it is that ſpeakes unto thee, thou wouldeſt have asked, &amp;c.</hi> That is, if thou wert ſenſible of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and vertue of this water, and thy need of it, thou wouldeſt be very inquiſitive how to get it, how to have a taſt of it. As in regard of Chriſt, and the benefits we have by him; ſo of ſin, and the evils which come by it: When a man hath confeſt and acknowledged his ſin, we may ſay to him, if thou didſt but know what thou haſt confeſt, if thou didſt but know what thou haſt acknowleged, thou wouldeſt preſently be asking, how ſhall I get free? how ſhall I get clear of theſe ſins w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are ſo deadly, poiſonous, deſtroying &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning? He that is but ſenſible what the wound of ſin is, wil never be at reſt, never give over enquiring, til he hath found a plaiſter or a medicine for it. He that knowes what he ſaith, when he ſaith I have ſinned, will reſolve, as <hi>David</hi> in another caſe, that his eyes ſhall not have a winke of ſleep, till he ſees where to have helpe againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that he ſaith, <hi>what ſhall I doe?</hi> Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a ſoule truly ſenſible of ſin, is ready to ſubmit to any termes which God ſhall put upon him. What ſhall I doe unto thee, O thou preſerver of men?</hi> Put what termes thou wilt upon me, I am ready to accept them. That was the ſence of their queſtion (Acts 2. 32.) <hi>what ſhall we do?</hi> ſhew us the way, let it be what it will, we will not ſtand making of conditions, we will not pick and chooſe, this we will doe, and that we will not doe, this we will ſubmit unto, and that we will refuſe; no, let the Lord write what articles he pleaſes, we intend not to debate, but yeeld and ſubſcribe unto them. When the Jaylor found himſelf in the bonds of his iniquity, he was ready to enter into any bonds of duty, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. <hi>Sirs, what muſt I doe to be ſaved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From the queſtion in the affirmative, Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God is to be conſulted and enquired after in all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſes, eſpecially in our ſin-caſes. I have ſinned, what ſhall I doe unto thee, O thou preſerver of men?</hi> He calls upon God, to know what he ſhould doe, and to learne what courſe he ſhould take. Though, when we have opportunity to ſpeake to men, that's good, and a duty; yet we muſt not reſt in the counſels of men, what to doe in ſin-caſes: God muſt be conſulted. After the people had committed idolatry in making the Calfe, <hi>you have ſinned</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) and now I will goe up unto the Lord, that I may make an attonement for you;</hi> I will goe up to the Lord, that I may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand from him, what courſe to take for the removing of this ſin,
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:40455:350"/> though we have not ſuch a mount to goe up unto, as <hi>Moſes</hi> then had to ſpeake to God; yet there are wayes for the ſoule in all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, to make addreſſes unto God; A ſinner may ſay, I will goe to the Lord, and make my attonement: whatſoever advice and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we receive from men, we muſt enquire whether it be an advice and counſel eſtabliſhed in Heaven. And the reaſon is cleare, God is the perſon offended in every ſin, and therefore he muſt be conſulted about the remedy of ſin. Again, God only can reſolve us what will pleaſe him; we may pitch upon a wrong courſe, and take a wrong way; we in ſtead of pacifying God, may provoke him? in ſtead of ſatisfying, further diſpleaſe him: Therefore we muſt ſay, when we have ſinned, Lord what wilt thou have us to doe? his advice will lead us to Chriſt for eaſe and peace.</p>
                  <p>So farre for the queſtion taken in the affirmative ſence, <hi>What ſhall I doe unto thee?</hi> ſhew me what I ſhall doe, and I will readily ſubmit unto it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take the queſtion negatively, <hi>what ſhall</hi> I <hi>doe unto thee?</hi> And ſo I find two ſences of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some render it thus, <hi>what have</hi> I <hi>done againſt thee?</hi> and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quid tibi neeui ant quid te laſi,</hi> Olymp.</note> then the meaning is this, I have done nothing againſt thee, or I have not hurt thee by ſinning: <hi>What have</hi> I <hi>done againſt thee?</hi> wherein have I injured thee, that thou layſt thy hand thus ſeverely upon me in theſe grievous afflictions, both upon my ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? I am hurt, what have I hurt thee? There is a truth in this: though I take it not for the truth of this place. A man may ſay <note place="margin">Paeecana noſtra beautm illam naturam tabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factare non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt.</note> when he hath ſinned what hurt have I done unto God? and yet all the hurt and wrong which God receives, he receives by ſin. Our ſins are no hurt unto God, by abating any thing of his happineſſe, or fullneſſe, or intrinſicall eſſentiall honour; take it thus, and our ſins cannot hurt God: All the darts of our ſins, fall infinitely ſhort of God, they cannot reach him, ſo, as to annoy him: And we have that language expreſſely in the 35 Chapter of this book of <hi>Job,</hi> ver 6. <hi>If thou doeſt ſin what doeſt thou againſt him?</hi> (that is, thou doeſt nothing againſt God, as a real dammage to him) <hi>or if thy tranſgreſſions be multiplied, what doeſt thou unto him?</hi> Sin as many ſins as you can, you cannot impare the happineſſe of God, or diminiſh his greatneſſe: he is out of the reach of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that ſence. As on the other ſide, if a man be never ſo holy and good, or do never ſo many acts of righteouſneſſe, yet God hath no good or gain by it, we cannot advantage God by our holineſs;
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:40455:350"/> and that is the language of this Scripture too, Job 35. 7. <hi>If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him; or what receiveth he of thine hand?</hi> We make no addition to the happineſſe of God by all our holineſſe, Job. 22. 3. <hi>Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or any gaine unto him that thou makeſt thy waies perfect? That which is infinite cannot increaſe, neither can it be increaſed.</hi> God is a above all gaine and loſſe, above all acceſſes of pleaſure or paine. When the Scripture ſaith, he is delighted in the ſervices of the Saints, and takes pleaſure in his people, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them in the ſame ſence, as thoſe Scriptures, which deſcribe him diſpleaſed with the ſins of men, angry and grieved, becauſe of their provocations. All the motions of Gods delight or griefe, pleaſedneſſe or diſpleaſure, are only expreſſions towards the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not any impreſſions upon himſelf. But I ſhall let that ſence paſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the negative, take the queſtion thus, <hi>What ſhall I doe unto thee?</hi> Or, as the Septuagint reades it, <hi>What can</hi> I <hi>doe unto thee?</hi> That is, I can doe nothing to thee? Lord I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and if thou ſeekeſt for ſatisfaction at my hands, I am able to make none. And ſo he ſpeaks like a poore, undone, broken man, to his rich creditour arreſting him for a dept, which he is unable to pay. The poore man fals downe at his feet, and ſaith, Sir, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I owe you a great ſumme, you have my bonds, I confeſſe my hand and ſeale, but what ſhall I doe unto you? I cannot pay you a penny, I have nothing, I have loſt all, I am not worth a groat, what will you have of me? This ſounds ſuch a kind of mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, pitifull language, <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I doe unto thee; O thou preſerver of men?</hi> Lord, when I looke into my ſtock, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my treaſure &amp; revenues, I ſee I have nothing to ſatisfie this debt of ſinne, I have run in, and ſtand engag'd to thy Majeſtie for; what can I pay thee? And ſo the word <hi>[doe]</hi> ſignifies a retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or recompence; ſo it is uſed in the ſecond verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where he ſpeaks of the hireling, waiting for his worke, that is, for the reward of recompence of his worke, the paiment of his wages. What ſhall I doe? is as much, as, what ſhall I pay, or what ſhall I render? This is a due debt, but I have nothing to pay, no way of making ſatisfaction, for all the dammage I have put thy holy Majeſty to, by my ſins.</p>
                  <p>Or thus, there may be a three-fold negation in the Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I doe unto thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="688" facs="tcp:40455:351"/>
                  <p> Firſt, I can doe nothing to eſcape thy power, I cannot get a way from thee, J cannot reſcue my ſelfe from under thy hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I can doe nothing to ſatisfie thy juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I can doe nothing, to pacifie thine anger. J cannot only not pay the dept, but I cannot appeaſe thee, or turn away thy diſpleaſure in the leaſt degree.</p>
                  <p>From the Queſtion taken in this ſence, we may obſerve. Firſt, That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The holieſt man on the earth by all his ſufferings and doings cannot ſatisfie the juſtice of God for one ſin. I have ſinned, what ſhall I doe unto thee?</hi> When the Angels had ſinned, what could they doe unto God, in this reſpect? Theſe three negations lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and doe lie to this day, and ſhall to all eternity. They ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but once, yet could they not eſcape out of the hand of God. Though ſpirits and powers, yet they could not maintaine their ſtate againſt the power of God, and are therefore caſt into priſon, and <hi>reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe to the judegement of the great day.</hi> They could not pacifie the wrath of God towards them, God is as highly diſpleaſed, and his wrath burns as hot againſt them, as ever. Now if ſinning Angels could doe nothing to God, what can ſinfull man doe? The Queſtion is put <hi>Micha</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Where with ſhall I come before the Lord? And bow my ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings? with calves of a yeare old? will the Lord be pleaſed with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of rams? or with ten thouſand rivers of oyle? ſhall I give my firſt-borne for my tranſgreſſion? the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoule?</hi> Theſe Queſtions are denials; come not before God with any of theſe. Then what is it, that God doth require? <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, what is good, to doe judgement and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> But why theſe things? What, though I cannot make a price for my ſin with calves and rams, and rivers of oyle, though my children will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as a ranſome for my tranſgreſſions, yet can I make a price for them, out of juſtice and righteouſneſſe and humble walking? No, not out of theſe neither. The Lord doth not require theſe, for the paiments of our debt, as we are ſinners, but for the paiments of duty, as we are creatures. There is a double debt to God: a debt to the juſtice of God for ſins commited, and a debt to the law of God for duties enjoyned. The former no man is able to pay, but with
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:40455:351"/> eternall ſufferings. The latter, the Saints (through grace) do pay by their dayly holy actings.</p>
                  <p>There is a three-fold deficiency in al that man can do, to ſatisfie the juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p>Friſt, all is imperfect and defiled, our ſervices ſmell of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, thorough which they paſſe, and taſte of the caske into which they are put. There is a ſtampe of our ſinfullneſs even upon our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. And can that which is ſinfull ſatisfie for ſin?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whatſoever we doe is a debt, before we doe it. All our duties are owing before we performe them. And can we pay the debt of ſin, by thoſe duties which were due, though ſin had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been commited?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The greateſt deficiency is this, our works want the ſtampe of Gods appointment for that purpoſe. <hi>God hath no where ſet up mans righteouſneſſe, as ſatisfaction for mans unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Hence, if it ſhould be ſuppoſed, we had performed perfect righteouſneſſe according to the whole will of God commanded, yet we could not ſatisfie the juſtice God offended, unleſſe God had ſaid, that he would accept that way of ſatisfaction; it is the appointment and inſtitution of God, which renders what we doe acceptable unto himſelfe. Surely, all that Jeſus Chriſt did or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us in the fleſh, had not ſatisfied the juſtice of God, if God had not appointed that Chriſt ſhould come to doe and ſuffer thoſe things for the ſatisfying of his juſtice. It was the compact between Chriſt and his Father, which made him a Saviour, <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire.</hi> Sacrifices were refuſed by God, it being impoſſible, that they ſhould purge ſin (Heb. 10. 4.) <hi>Then the eare of Chriſt was opened or bored;</hi> as a ſervant, according to the law in that caſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 6. to receive and doe the will of his Father. Or, as the <hi>Seventy</hi> interpret, which the Apoſtle fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>God prepared him a body.</hi> Then Chriſt undertakes the worke, <hi>And ſaid, loe I come to doe thy will O God. Why? In the volume of the booke it is written of me.</hi> That is, thou haſt decreed and ordained from everlaſting; The record is cleare for it, that I am he, whom thou haſt ordained to doe thy will: Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle concludes at the 10th verſe, <hi>That we are ſanctified</hi> (that is, ſaved) <hi>by that will through the offering of the body of Jeſus once for all:</hi> As inſerting, that the very offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt could not ſave us, but by the will and ordination of God. His hanging and dying on the croſſe had not delivered us from
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:40455:352"/> death, unleſſe it had been written in <hi>the volume of the Booke.</hi> There is nothing ſatisfactory, but what the law, or the will of the Law-giver makes, or agrees to accept, as ſatisfactorie. In the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the booke, there is nothing written, which appoints man ſuch a work, and therefore he cannot doe it.</p>
                  <p>There is ſome what to be done by way of thankfullneſſe, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done by way of paiment. That queſtion <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 116. 12.) affirmes as much, <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> We muſt render unto the Lord for his benefits; but we cannot render to the Lord for our ſins. We ought to take up the Cup of Thankſgiving: but Chriſt hath, and he alone was able, and he alone was ordained to take and drinke the Cup of Satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve (which depends upon the former.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That pradon and forgiveneſſe of ſinne, come in at the doore of free-grace.</hi> Free-grace doth all. <hi>What can I do?</hi> J can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>O thou preſerver of men;</hi> J can only (nor that without thy helpe) acknowledge my ſin: it muſt be thine infinite goodneſs to pardon it. When a man hath travell'd through all duties and doings, he muſt at laſt ſit downe in Gods love, and reſt in this, that God is mercifull to poore ſinners, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Come unto me, O all yee that are thirſtie, come without money or without price:</hi> There is nothing in the creature that God requires as a price of his favor: his milk and his hony, his bread and his water are al gifts and bounties unto his people. He cals us to buy theſe becauſe we ſhall have them, as willingly from God, as any things from man, for our mony; &amp; he cals it a buying without mony, becauſe no value can be ſet upon it high enough, nor any heart receive it freely enough. <hi>To offer mony,</hi> that is, to think to obtain any of that favor, by what we do, is the moſt dangerous offer in the world. We read how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the iſſue was to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> when he offered mony, <hi>for the gifts of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and yet thoſe gifts were ſuch, as a man may have, and go to hell with them, for they were but gifts of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and of healing, and the like: But this gift of the favour and love of God in the pardon of ſin, is ſuch a gift, as whoſoever hath it, is ſure and ſafe for ever: And therefore (the gift being much more precious than that of <hi>Simon Magus)</hi> Take heed of offering this kind of mony for it, your works and doings. <hi>To doe ſo is the worſt Simonie in the world.</hi> Better offer literall money for thoſe gifts of the holy Ghoſt, then this figurative money for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:40455:352"/> of God in the pardon of ſin. What <hi>Peter</hi> threatned <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> may be affirmed of them. <hi>Their money muſt periſh with them,</hi> That is, their prayers and teares, their ſorrows and their humblings, their almes and good deeds, foraſmuch as they have thought, that this gift of pardon may be obtained by ſuch money. They have neither part nor lot in that mercy, for their hearts are not right in the ſight of God. <hi>A good worke truſted to, is as mortall, as a ſin unrepented of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, There is ſomewhat to be done, when we have ſinn'd but nothing to be paid. That's Goſpel-language, when a man hath ſinned, to ſay, <hi>What ſhall I doe?</hi> Thoſe converts in the <hi>Acts</hi> who enquired, <hi>What ſhall we doe?</hi> were told by the Apoſtles of ſome what to be done, <hi>Repent and be baptized, believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Theſe are waies wherein ſalvation is tender'd, not works for which it is beſtowed. It is a dangerous error, ſo to lift up the grace of God, as to deny the induſtry of man through grace, &amp; becauſe he can do nothing by way of ſatisfaction, that, therefore he muſt doe nothing. The Apoſtles gave Goſpel-counſell, yet when men asked them, <hi>what ſhall we doe to be ſaved?</hi> They ſaid not, ye muſt doe nothing, God will ſave you by his free-grace: no, they called them to repent and beleeve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take heed, when ye have ſinned, to ſay we need not mourne for ſin, we need not be humbled, we need not repent, for, Lord, what can we do unto thee, O thou Saviour of men? Theſe are the inferences of our own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, not of the Spirit of Chriſt. They who lift up the grace of Chriſt, to leſſen the neceſſity of gracious actings in themſelves, ſhew they know not the meaning of his grace, and have not indeed taſted how gracious the Lord is. To deny our owne righteouſneſſe, and to be very active in the waies of righteouſneſſe is the due <hi>Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper.</hi> The Apoſtle, Phil. 3. 8. <hi>counts all things but loſſe and dung;</hi> all duties and humblings, all legall righteouſneſſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, not that he refuſed righteouſneſſe, or neglected duties, but he would not mingle them with Chriſt, or bring them in as contributions to the purchaſe of bleſſedneſſe. Our righteouſneſſe and holy duties are dung and droſſe in juſtification; but they are gold and precious things in ſanctification: without theſe, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk worthy of our holy calling, or, as it becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>So much for theſe words, <hi>what ſhall I doe unto thee?</hi>

                  <p>Again, Preſerving or keeping may be underſtood two waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a preſerving or keeping of man, that he ſhal not eſcape. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A preſerving or keeping of man, that he ſhall not <note place="margin">Cuſtos hominu, ſc. qui homine talibus malis quaſi quadam cuſtodia inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis it non ſit ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugium.</note> take hurt.

                     <pb n="693" facs="tcp:40455:353"/> 
                     <hi>from thee, I am lockt up within iron-gates and barrs, what woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou have me doe unto thee? Thou maieſt put what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thou pleaſeſt upon me, I muſt ſubmit.</hi> Such language we have <hi>(Lam.</hi> 3. 5, 7.) which may illuſtrate this, <hi>He hath builded againſt me, and compaſſed me with gall and travell, he hath hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me about, that I cannot get out, he hath made my chaine hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie.</hi> You ſee, he ſpeakes of God (as we may ſpeake with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) as of the maſter of a priſon, who ſaith to his under-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, there is ſuch a one, looke to him well make his chaine hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, that he may not get a way, put him in a place, where there is a ſtrong wall, leaſt he breake priſon. This ſence of the word makes <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking like <hi>Jeremy, He hath builded againſt me, he hath compaſſed me about, he hath made my chaine heavie upon me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the ſecond ſence, according to the letter of our Tranſlation, is moſt cleare and apt, <hi>O thou preſerver of men!</hi> Thou, who kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt man, leaſt he take hurt or fall into danger; As if <hi>Job</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke God, thus, Thou art the Saviour and protectour of men, thou haſt not only given man a being, but thou provideſt for his well-being: thou art a preſerver of our outward eſtates, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of our ſpirituall eſtates; A God, in whom we live, move, and have our being, as well, as we receive being, life and motion from thee; and therefore ſeeing ſuch is thy nature, and this thy office, to be a preſerver of men, what wouldſt thou have me to doe unto thee? Why doſt thou thus deſtroy me, and breake me to peeces? Why doſt thou follow me with affliction upon affliction, till I am utterly ruin'd and undone? Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> (Gen, 28. 15.) <hi>If thou wilt keepe me in the way that I ſhall go,</hi> he makes a vow to God, and indents or articles with God to be kept and preſerved by him, The word there is <hi>Thomer,</hi> but that and this are uſed promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as Pſal. 121. 4. <hi>The keeper of Iſrael,</hi> In the word of the text, and Pſal. 31. 23. <hi>The Lord preſerveth the faithfull;</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth them, from the reach of dangers and troubles incompaſsing them on every ſide.</p>
                  <p>So then in this title, we have the worke and office of God held forth, the ſecond act of his power. The firſt is the act of creation, the ſecond is this act of preſervation or providence. Preſervation or ptovidence is a continued creation. Obſerve from this title; Firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man wants a preſerver.</hi> If God having made man, and ſet
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:40455:354"/> him in the world, had left him to his own keeping, what would become of him? When God truſted man to goe a little alone, and did not hold a ſpeciall hand of preſervation over him, to keepe him from or in temptation, how quickly did he fall and looſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? Man like a little child (which if the mother or the nurſe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth alone unwatched or uneyed) runs into dangers and deaths e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment. Man is a weake creature, therefore he needs a preſerver. Againe, man (as fallen eſpecially) is a fooliſh crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he hath no underſtanding to guide himſelfe, he is as ignorant as a child (if God leave him) how to diſpoſe of his own waies, and order his goings; <hi>The way of man is not in himſelfe, neither is it in him that goeth to direct his own ſteps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Man walks in the midſt of enemies. He is beſet with dangers, therefore he needs a protectour; what would become of a man, living in a throng of adverſaries, were it not that he hath a God, whoſe name is <hi>the preſerver of men?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is good for us to know God by this Name in every letter of it, in the full extent of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Immediately, his owne hand and out-ſtretched arme, is our ſafety, Zech. 2. 5. <hi>I will be unto Jeruſalem a wall of fire round</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mirus ſane Dei amor in populu ſuum, mira pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videmia Sanct. in</hi> Zech. 2,</note> 
                     <hi>about;</hi> If you want a wall, I will be your wall, my immediate providence ſhall be your defence, rather then you ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. <hi>Is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones, or is my fleſh braſſe?</hi> was <hi>Jobs</hi> queſtion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 12. We may reſolve it, the ſtrength of God is more then the ſtrength of ſtones, and he, <hi>The Spirit</hi> is more firme then braſſe. The <hi>Romans</hi> in their warrs uſed to call out the <hi>Tutelar gods</hi> of thoſe Cities they beſieged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as believing them a ſtronger defence to thoſe places, than wals or forts. And yet our God is more then a wall of ſtone or braſſe, he promiſed to be a wall of fire. Now, who can batter downe a fire, that is it's own fewell, or who can ſet up ladders to ſcale the flames?</p>
                  <p>And as the Lord is a wall of fire, ſo a wall of water for the ſafety of his people, Iſa. 33. 21. <hi>there will I be a place of broad rivers, and of ſtreames;</hi> that is, I will be their preſervation; the broad river preſerves a place from the invaſion of enemies: waters are ſtronger then bulwarks of ſtones. And leaſt any ſhould object, though broad rivers keepe of Foot or Horſe, yet they give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſhips; therefore it is added, I will be ſuch a river to thee, <hi>as wherein ſhall goe no galley with oares, neither ſhall gallant Ship paſſe thereby.</hi> But if any ſhall venture their Navies upon
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:40455:354"/> theſe ſtreames to thy annoyance, then know (as the 23. <hi>verſ.</hi> intimates). <hi>Their tacklings ſhall be looſed, they ſhall not well ſtrengthen their maſts, they ſhall not ſpread their ſailes;</hi> They ſhall be ſo ruffled and entangled, <hi>that the lame ſhall take the prey,</hi> that is, the weakeſt reſiſtance ſhall ſubdue them and make prize of their whole fleete, even of their invincible Armado's. <hi>I love the Lord my ſtrength, my rock, my tower, my fortreſſe, my buckler, the horne of my ſalvation; Pſ.</hi> 18. 1, 2. all theſe titles meete in this one, <hi>The preſerver of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is a preſerver of men mediatly by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: he preſerves man by man, and man ſometimes by the beaſts of the earth, and fowles of the ayre, but chiefely he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth men by Angels; <hi>Are they not miniſtring ſpirits, ſent out for the good of thoſe that ſhall be heires of ſalvation?</hi> (Pſa. 91.) <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy wayes, they ſhall beare thee up in thy wayes, leaſt thou daſh thy foote againſt a ſtone.</hi> A promiſe ſo full of ſweetneſſe for faith to feed on, that the devil hath no way to elude it, but by tempting us (as he did Chriſt) to over-act it, &amp; ſurfet faith into a preſumption, by a wilfull needleſſe throwing our ſelves into danger.</p>
                  <p>And there is a neceſſity that God himſelf ſhould thus take upon him the preſervation of men: This neceſſity is three-fold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. None are ſtrong enough to preſerve us without him, our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would breake thorough all ſtrength below God: ſo that, if he were not our preſerver, none could: <hi>In vaine is ſalvation hoped for from hils, and from the multitude of mountains; truly in the Lord our God is the ſalvation of Iſrael.</hi> Jer. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. None are wiſe enough to preſerve us, except the Lord. As evill ſpirits are <hi>powers,</hi> for ſtrength; ſo likewiſe <hi>ſerpents,</hi> for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and craft; this craft of hell cannot be diſcovered, much leſſe diſappointed, without wiſedome from Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. None but God are patient enough to be the preſervers of men, I beleeve if the Angels left to their naturall temper, were ſet to be keepers of men, they had all given over this charge long before this time, as it is ſuppoſed, they who fell, refuſed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, or take it up, at firſt, Angels have not the patience to keepe ſuch a froward peece as man. It is a wonder God doth not give over that care, and in ſtead of preſerving daſh him in peeces. When the Lord told <hi>Moſes, he would ſend an Angel before him, and drive out the Canaanite</hi> (Exod. 34. 2.) <hi>For I will not goe up</hi>
                     <pb n="696" facs="tcp:40455:355"/> 
                     <hi>in the midſt of thee, for thou art a ſtiffe-necked people, leaſt I conſume thee in the way.</hi> The text ſaith, <hi>when the people heard this evill tidings, they mourned, and no man did put upon him his ornaments.</hi> Why, what was it that troubled them? was it that the Angel is ſent now to conduct them to <hi>Canaan?</hi> That was told them <hi>(Chap.</hi> 23. 20.) and they well ſatisfied with it, <hi>Behold, I ſend an Angel before thee, to keepe thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</hi> I anſwer, The Angel in the 23. Chapter is by all (that I meet with) agreed to be the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Angel of the Covenant; but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, <hi>chap.</hi> 33. appeares to be a created Angel and rather threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, then promiſed them. And though the Lord is pleaſed to ſignifie a reaſon of ſending this Angel in favour to them, namely, leaſt <hi>he himſelfe conſume them in the way, for their ſtubborneſſe.</hi> Yet the people are not ſatisfied with this tidings; ſurely they thought if the Lord was not able to bear their provocations, much leſſe could an Angel, and therefore if he ſhould ſend an Angel, and withdraw his own preſence from them, they muſt periſh; A meere Angel could not have borne their manners as the Lord did; receiving provocations from them, and continuing preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions over them thoſe forty yeares.</p>
                  <p>It is yet further obſerveable, that the Hebrew is not only ſingular, but a particular: <hi>The preſerver of Adam,</hi> or, of <hi>that man,</hi> which hath ſome ſpeciality in it, We tranſlate in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, <hi>the preſerver of men;</hi> but the <hi>preſerver of man,</hi> or of <hi>that man,</hi> is more emphaticall. God preſerveth all, but he hath a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall eye of preſervation upon ſome, <hi>Thou preſerveſt man and beaſt,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, the beaſts of the earth are preſerved, but man is preſerved more: And among men, ſome are more preſerved. It is a truth, the great God preſerveth his greateſt enemies; a wicked man were not able to lift up a hand or a tongue againſt him, if God did not uphold him: but God is the ſpeciall preſerver of <hi>that man,</hi> that is, the preſerver of <hi>a godly man,</hi> or of godly men. As Chriſt is <hi>the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve; ſo the preſerver of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve;</hi> he hath a care of them, beyound the care he hath of the world. The care which God hath of the reſt of the world, compared with that towards his own, is but careleſſeneſſe, and he (as it were) neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the whole world to looke to his own people. As it was ſaid of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that for the love he bare to <hi>Conſtatinople,</hi> he undreſs'd
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:40455:355"/> and unadorn'd al the other Cities of the Empire, to beautifie and adorn that: God ſeems to take off from al men in the world, to lay it on, upon his people; The very gleanings of thoſe mercies which his people have, are better then the whole vintage of the world: And the Lord is therefore a ſpecial Saviour to his people, becauſe,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are more precious than the reſt of the world: and that cals for moſt care, which hath moſt worth. A man takes more care of his jewels, then of the lumber in his houſe; <hi>Theſe are my Jewels,</hi> ſaith God <hi>(Mal.</hi> 3.) A man carries his jewels about him, or keeps them in a ſafe cabinet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Neereneſſe of relation calls for that care; will not a man perſerve his wife, his ſpouſe? The Church is the ſpouſe of Chriſt. Will not a man preſerve his children? if his houſe be on fire, bring my children out ſaith he: The heart of God is towards his children, he muſt provide them a porton. Yea they are his portion, he makes a revenew of them <hi>(Deut.</hi> 32. 9.) A man will preſerve his revenew, that wherein his eſtate lies: All that God hath on earth (though he hath ſuch a fulneſſe in himſelfe, that he needs nothing from his Church, yet, al that he hath) he is pleaſed to ſay, he hath it from his Church: and therefore God is ſaid to be <hi>great in Zion;</hi> He is the ſame great God all the world over, but it appeares not ſo, what he is, to the men of the world, as to the Saints in <hi>Zion</hi> it doth: yea he is little in the eye of the world, in compariſon of what he is in <hi>Zion,</hi> therefore he takes great care to preſerve his <hi>Zion.</hi> Laſtly obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The preſerving care of God over man, eſpecially over that man, over his own people, is a perpetuall care.</hi> Preſervation is a continued act, if God ſhould leave us one moment, and ſtop providence, creation would be diſſolved: This continuance of his care, is eminent towards his Church; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3. <hi>Leaſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</hi> Night and day divide all time between them: to do a thing night and day, is to do it continually. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 121. 4. <hi>He that keepeth Iſrael, neither ſlumbreth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſleepeth;</hi> A ſlumber is leſſe than ſleepe; but God will not ſo much as ſlumber in his thoughts towards us, all his, are waking thoughts. Futher, his love is without intermiſſion, that knowes no ſtops nor breaches, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his care is ſo too.

And the word may be taken ſimply for an enemy, or adverſary, who ſtands oppoſite to us, both in his actions and deſignes, and againſt whom we direct both ours. We render, <hi>wherefore haſt thou ſet me as a marke?</hi> and that ſuites the ſence of the word fully, becauſe a marke at which a man aimes, is ſet in direct oppoſition to him; we levell our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes or bullets at the marke right before us, <hi>Job</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus placed, <hi>why haſt thou ſet me as a marke</hi> to meete with, or intercept thy ſhot, thy arrowes, thy bullets, thy blowes upon my breaſt? Wilt thou make the boſome of thy ſervants, like the breaſt of an enemy, a <hi>But</hi> to receive all thy arrows? A mark is as a ſtanding enemy; and an enemy is a moving marke to ſhoote at: a marke is a liveleſſe enemy, and an enemy is a living marke: his meaning then is; Thou haſt ſet me againſt thee, as if I were an enemy,
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:40455:356"/> as if I were one, againſt whom thou reſolveſt to direct all thine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and aim every ſtroke: ſo the word is uſed, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 21. where <hi>Zeba and Zalmunna,</hi> two Kings taken captive by <hi>Gideon,</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>riſe thou and fall upon us;</hi> it is this word, ſet us before thee as a marke for thy victorious ſword: So the Prophet <hi>(Amos</hi> 5. 19.) tels us that a man in hopes to eſcape the hand of God, <hi>ſhall be as if a man did flee from a Lion, and a Bear met him,</hi> ſuch a man is but a mark for a Bear, who thinks to out-runne this Lion. That expreſſion (1 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 4.) is very clear to this ſenſe, where the peacefulneſs of <hi>Solomons</hi> reigne is deſcribed, thus, <hi>there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adverſary nor evil occurrent;</hi> the word we tranſlate, <hi>evill occurrent,</hi> it is that in the text, no evil met or befel them. So then the ſum of all is, That <hi>Job</hi> expoſtulates or complaines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, that he was as it were, the man choſen out amongſt all the men in the world, to be as the mark and But againſt which God ſhot his afflictions, and level'd all his arrows: As if he had ſaid; There are many mo about me, and thou doeſt not ſo much as touch one of the hairs of their heads, there are men that receive not ſo much as one ſhot from thee, but I am made thy ſtanding marke, why is it thus Lord? So he expreſſeth himſelf, in other words, but to this very ſenſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>chap</hi> 13. 24. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holdeſt thou me for thine enemy?</hi> or (according to the letter of the Hebrew) among thoſe who ſtraighten thee, as an enemy ſtraightens a City, in the time of a ſiedge: And this he doth to move God to pity and compaſſion; Lord, ſaith he, I am ſet as a mark againſt thee. You would be much moved (a tender heart would) to ſee a man bound faſt to a poſt, and another ſtanding off with his bow bent, and his arrow on the ſtring, with his gun or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll cockt, aiming at his breaſt: <hi>Job</hi> preſents himſelf in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as if the Lord had bound him faſt to a poſt or to a tree, and were pouring vollies of ſhot, and ſending ſhowers of arrows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him continually.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, firſt the manner of the language, which is by way of a vehement queſtion, or expoſtulation, <hi>Why haſt thou ſet me as a marke againſt thee?</hi>

                  <p>

                     <pb n="700" facs="tcp:40455:357"/> 
                     <hi>hast thou ſet me as a marke?</hi> as if he had ſaid; if I could but learne this, and ſee the reaſon of it, ſurely I ſhould receive thy wounds as kiſſes, and take thy ſtroakes as embraces. When <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaw ſo many evils and troubles upon <hi>Iſrael, Jud.</hi> 6. and the Angel told him, <hi>the Lord was with him,</hi> Then, <hi>why is it thus</hi> (ſaith he) Can you give me a reaſon, why God being with us, it is thus with us? <hi>To know the reaſon of our paine, is a great eaſe, and almoſt the care of it.</hi> If the people of God did but know what infinite reaſon he hath (reaſon of the higheſt temperament of wiſdome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) why he layes affliction upon them, and makes them as his markes, they would be abundantly ſatisfied with it. What is the reaſon why the Saints coming out of great affliction, are willing to confeſſe, <hi>it is good for us that we were afflicted, and bleſſed be God that we were chaſtned.</hi> It is, becauſe then they ſee more cleerly the reaſon why God afflicted them, and they then begin to taſt the fruit of thoſe afflictions. If while the affliction is upon us, we knew what good God meaneth us, what honour he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth us, we ſhould beare it, not onely with courage and with patience, but, with joy. If <hi>Iob</hi> had been but fully acquainted with this, that God therefore ſet him up as a mark to ſhoot at, that he might be to all the world a mirror of patience: that God intended him this honour, that his name ſhould be upon record in his Book ſo long as there was a Church, ſurely he would have borne all with more patience and eaſe than he did; But he was groping in the darke, and therefore enquires, <hi>wherefore haſt thou ſet me as a marke against thee?</hi> The words are not only, or not ſo much, an expoſtulation, becauſe he was ſet as a marke, as an inquiſition, why he was ſet as a marke. Thirdly note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God ſometimes ſeemes an enemie to his faithfull ſervants.</hi> For one to be before God as a But continually ſhot at, what other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation can ſenſe make of it, but this, that God looks upon him as an enemy? <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaith of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> (Gen. 49. 23.) <hi>the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers have ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him. Joſeph</hi> was as the common marke of his Bretherens envy. But in this caſe, as it is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi> (Gen. 42.) when his brethren came to him, <hi>he made himſelf strange to them. (Joſeph</hi> ſtrained himſelfe, and uſed his art, to overcome his nature, <hi>he made himſelfe ſtrange: Joſeph</hi> was of a meek and loving diſpoſition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like a Player upon a ſtage, he only acted the part of a rigid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or governor.) Thus many times the Lord takes upon him the
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:40455:357"/> poſture of an enemy, and forces a frowne upon a poor creature, whom he loves and delights in with all his heart; he makes him as his marke to ſhoot at, whom he layes next his own heart. Thus the Church ſpeakes, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>He hath bent his bow, and ſet me as a marke for his arrowes;</hi> And <hi>(Job</hi> 16. 13.) that, you may ſee how his language agrees with other Scriptures; <hi>His archers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe me round about, he cleaveth my reines aſunder, and doth not spare. He poureth out my gall upon the ground.</hi> How exactly he ſpeakes! A man ſhootes at a haires bredth that ſhootes thus; when God ſends his archers, their bowes ſhoote ſo true, that they cleave the reines aſunder: the reines are in the middeſt of a man, and to cleave the reines, is to ſhoot level: as pouring out the gall, or unbowelling, imports to ſhoot dead.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly obſerve this, <hi>Why haſt thou ſet me as a mark?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God takes the most eminent and choiſeſt of his ſervants, for the choiceſt and most eminent afflictions.</hi> He makes a <hi>Job the white.</hi> Why haſt thou choſen me? There was great reaſon, God ſhould chooſe him, he was the moſt eminent in holineſs and grace of all about him: he was the moſt remarkable man for grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, therefore he muſt be the marke. They who have received moſt grace from God, are able to bear moſt affliction from God. God doth this in infinite wiſdome: as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11. gives an excellent advice in reference to weake brethren, <hi>ſuch as are weak receive, but not to doubtful diſputations;</hi> take heed how you ingage your weake brethren in doubtfull diſputes, you may looſe them ſo; take thoſe that are ſtrong and able, ſuch as have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evill, ſuch as are well ballaſted for a ſtorme, take theſe men, if you will, to doubtfull diſputations, but doe not take weake brethren. If God will not have us take a weak Chriſtian to a doubtful diſputation; ſurely then, he calls ſuch to ſufferings, of whoſe ſtrengh he is well aſſured: A man under great affliction, is brought to a very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſputation; therefore the Lord will not bring a weak one, one low in grace to it, but he takes out the ſtrong: As the General of an Army chooſes out the valianteſt and moſt experienced vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane Souldiers, to put them upon hard adventures, it is not wiſdom to venture a freſh-water Souldier upon difficult ſervices. God will not put new wine into old bottles: as it is in acting duties, ſo in ſufferings. And as Chriſt orders the word in ſuch wiſdom, that he will not have counſel given, to any ſoul, who is unprepared to
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:40455:358"/> receive it, or unable to bear it. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 12. <hi>I have many things yet to ſay unto you, but you cannot beare them now;</hi> therefore I will deferre, until you have got more ſtrength: So God ſaith of a young Chriſtian, one that is newly come in; thou haſt great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to undergoe before thou dyeſt, but thou art not fit to beare them yet, I will defer thy triall till thou art grown more hardie, through more communion with me, to fit thee for that encounter. As our Lord Chriſt told <hi>Peter</hi> (Joh. 21. 18.) <hi>When thou waſt young, thou girdest thy ſelf, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt stretch forth thy hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whether thou wouldest not.</hi> That is, when thou waſt young and unexperienced thou enjoyeſt thy liberty; but when thou ſhalt be grown older in years, and ſtronger in grace, thou ſhalt willingly ſtretch forth thy hands, and quietly ſuffer thy ſelf to be bound to the Croſſe <hi>(Peter</hi> was not nailed as Chriſt, but tied to the Croſſe) and there die in witneſs of my truth; <hi>for this Chriſt spake, ſignifying by what death he ſhould die and glorifie God,</hi> ver. 19.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, In that he ſaith, <hi>Why hast thou ſet me as a marke against thee? Why doest thou run thus against me?</hi> Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man in ſinning, runneth contrary to God, and God in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſeemeth to run contrary to man.</hi> Every act of ſin, is a direct oppoſition unto God: we ſet God as a marke, and ſhoot arrows of diſobedience againſt him; ſin is a miſſing the mark of duty, but it ames to hit the Lord, as a mark, who charges us with that duty. In affliction God runneth upon us, and makes the trangreſſor his marke. <hi>Moſes</hi> (Levit. 26. 41.) ſpeakes both wayes; <hi>If your uncircumciſed hearts be humbled, and ye acknowledge that ye have walked contrary unto me, and that I have walked contrary unto you,</hi> that I have made you a marke, and ſhot at you by my judgements, and that you have made me a marke, ſhooting at me by your ſins; then <hi>I will remember, &amp;c.</hi> So that our ſinning is a walking contrary unto God, and Gods corrections are his walking contrary to us: There is an excellent expreſſion, noting how ſin ſtrikes, (and as it were) ſhoots at God <hi>(Iob</hi> 15. 25, 26.) <hi>He stretcheth out his hand against God</hi> ſpeaking of a wicked man) <hi>and strengtheneth himſelfe against the Almighty;</hi> (here this word is uſed) <hi>he runneth upon him; even on his neck, upon the thick boſſes of his bucklers.</hi> See how he deſcribes a wicked man in his natural courſe; what doth he? he runs upon God, he
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:40455:358"/> runneth upon him, even upon his neck; as a man that encounters an enemy, runs upon him, and ſets his feet upon his neck; he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth upon the thick boſſes of his bucklers, a warrier hath boſſes upon his arms, both for beauty and defence. The enemy runs upon the very boſſes and fears nothing: ſuch is a wicked man He runs againſt God; wil not God run upon him? He wil certainly be upon the boſſes of their bucklers, and upon their necks too, one time or other, till they ſhall be forced to cry out, that as they have been burdens unto God, ſo now they are burdens to themſelves. Thus <hi>Job</hi> concludes in his own caſe.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Rabbins</hi> obſerve, that this was the ancient reading of the Text, <hi>I am a burthen unto thee,</hi> and that the Scribes, who wrote out the Bibles in Hebrew, made this alteration, <hi>a burthen to my ſelf;</hi> becauſe they conceived it was unbecoming the Majeſtie of God, that <hi>Job</hi> ſhould ſay, he was a burthen to him. There is a general truth in that tranſlation, <hi>a burthen unto thee;</hi> The ſins of man are burthenſome to God, the frowardneſs and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of men, are burthenſome unto God: But I conceive our tranſlation carries the ſenſe fairer, in a reflection upon his owne tired ſpirits, <hi>So that I am made a burthen to my ſelfe,</hi> that is, thou doſt even throw me upon my ſelf, whereas heretofore thou waſt wont to bear me, and take my burthen upon thy ſelf. Alas I faint, I cannot ſtand under my ſelf, I am weary of my life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am left alone to bear it, I know not what to do with my ſelf, I am ſo burthenſome to my ſelf. Hence obſerve. Firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Outward afflictions, poverty, ſickneſs, want, &amp;c. are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and they make a man burthenſome to himſelf.</hi> It is a great burthen to have our comforts taken away from us. The removing
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:40455:359"/> of comforts lies like a heavy weight upon the ſpirit: the removing of health from the body is a weight upon the ſoul; fear is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, care is a burthen, and ſo is pain. Therefore God cals us to caſt all thoſe burthens upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 22. Secondly, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man left to himſelf, is not able to bear himſelfe.</hi> Man is much borne down by the weight of natural corruption. Hence the Apoſtle cals it, <hi>A weight and the ſinne which doth ſo eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet us,</hi> (Heb. 12. 1.) or dangle about our heels, to burden us, as long garments do a man that runneth. Our ordinary callings and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, left upon our own backs preſſe us to the earth, much more do our extraordinary troubles and afflictions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adviſeth, <hi>Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord</hi> (he aſſures in the next words) <hi>and he ſhall ſuſtaine thee.</hi> As implying, that man cannot ſuſtaine or beare his owne weight. And though, it ſhould ſeem we have ſtrengh to ſpare for others, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded to bear one anothers burthens, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 6.) yet no man of himſelf, no not the holieſt <hi>Atlas,</hi> nor the ſpiritualleſt Porter on earth, is able to bear his owne ſelf, unleſs Chriſt be his ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who is alſo, therefore, ſaid to <hi>uphold all thiags by the word of his power,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. Becauſe no creature in a natural, or man in a ſpiritual capacity can bear his own weight.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the connexion between theſe two phraſes, <hi>Thou haſt ſet me as a marke againſt thee, ſo that I am a burthen to my ſelf;</hi> what is it that makes my life to be ſo burthenſome to me? It is this, becauſe I am ſet as a mark before thee, that is, becauſe thou ſeemeſt to be an enemy to me: And ſo the note from the connexion is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which preſſes and burthens the ſoule ahove all, is the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that God is against us. Job</hi> in many things looked unto God under theſe temptations, with ſad thoughts, as if he were his enemy: ſo he expreſs'd himſelf in the ſixth Chapter, <hi>The poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his arrows drinks up my ſpirits, he ſetteth himſelfe in battel array against me.</hi> In theſe temptations and deſertions, this was the burden of his ſpirit, that God appeared as an adverſary, <hi>Why doest thou ſet me as a marke against thee?</hi> Let the Sabians and the Chaldeans ſhoot at me as much as they will, let fire and windes contend with me, and make me the marke of their utmoſt fury; I can beare all theſe. <hi>Job</hi> was light hearted enough, when he thought he contended onely with creatures, and that creatures onely
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:40455:359"/> contended with him; but in the progreſſe of this triall he finds God againſt him, withdrawing comforts from, and ſhooting ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours at him; now he is a burthen to himſelf, he can beare this no longer. As <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid in the Senate (when he had many wounds given him, yet this wounded him moſt, that he was wounded by the hand of his ſon) <hi>What thou my ſonne?</hi> So when a believer looks this way and that way, and fees many enemies, Satan and the creatures, all in armes againſt him; he can beare all their charges and aſſaults, but if he apprehend God oppoſing and wounding him, he weepes out this mourneful complaint, <hi>What thou my Father? What thou my God?</hi> Thou who haſt ſo often ſhined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, doſt thou darken thy face towards me, and appeare mine enemy! Theſe apprehenſions of God, will make the ſtrongeſt Saint on earth, a burden too heavy for himſelfe to beare. That which cauſeth the moſt burdenſome thoughts in the Saints, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidence of their pardon; Sin unpardon'd is in it ſelf a burden: and our not knowing ſin to be pardon'd, is a greater burden: but our jealouſies and fears, that it is not pardon'd, is the greateſt burden of all, and that which adds weight, yea an intolerableneſs to all other burdens. Hence <hi>Job</hi> in the next verſe, and with the laſt breath of his anſwer, points directly at that which pincht him.</p>
                  <q>Verſe 21. <hi>And why doeſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſſion, and take away mine iniquitie? for now ſhall I ſleep in the duſt, and thou ſhall ſeek me in the morning, but I ſhall not be.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>In the former verſe we found <hi>Job</hi> humbly confeſſing his ſin, and earneſtly enquiring of the Lord a reaſon of his ſorrowes, why he had ſhot him ſo full of arrows, that now he was not ſo much wounded as loaded, <hi>And become a burthen to himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this verſe he ſues for the pardon of thoſe ſins, and ſo for the removal of thoſe ſorrows. That the bow might ſpeedily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bended, and not a ſhot more made at his bleeding breaſt. In the anſwer of which ſuite, he deſires ſpeed and expedition, leſt help being retarded, come too late: for he profeſſeth that he cannot hold out his ſiedge long, he muſt needs make his bed in the grave, and then being ſought for, he ſhall not be found.</p>
                  <q>And why doſt thou not pardon my trangreſſions?</q>
                  <p>We may conſider the words two waies.</p>

                  <p>In the forme, they are a vehement expoſtulation. <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit hath been heated all along with the fire of his ſufferings, and here he ſpeakes in the heat of his ſpirit, and with fiery deſires after mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: He keepes up his heart to the ſame height and tenour ſtill, There it was, <hi>Why haſt thou ſet me as a mark againſt thee?</hi> Here's another <hi>Why, and why doſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſſion?</hi> As before he was grieved to be ſet up <hi>as a mark</hi> for afflictions to aime at; ſo now he deſires to be made a <hi>marke</hi> for mercy to aim at.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall note one thing from hence, before I come to open the words; <hi>They who are ſenſible of the evill of ſinne, will pray hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for the pardon of ſinne.</hi> Expoſtulation is earneſt prayer; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation is a vehement poſtulation, a vehement enquiring after or deſiring of a thing, <hi>Why doſt thou not pardon my ſinne?</hi> may be reſolved into this, <hi>O that thou wouldeſt pardon my ſinne!</hi> Or, <hi>Wilt thou not pardon my ſinne?</hi> The matter of this prayer requires ſuch a forme, ſuch a vehemency of ſpirit in him that prayes. If there be any petition in the world about which the ſpirit ſhould be fired, it is in this, when wee pray for pardon of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Will not a man whoſe body is defiled by falling into the mire, call haſtily for ſome to cleanſe and waſh him? Will he not ſay, if it come not ſpeedily, why do ye not bring away the water there, ſin is the defiling and bemiring of the ſoul, and pardon is the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it.</p>
                  <p>If a man be deeply and deadly wounded, will hee have onely ſome few feeble deſires, or make cold requeſts for a Chyrurgion. Will hee not call and call aloud? Call and call again for helpe and healing? Sins are the wounds of the ſoul, and pardon is the only cure of it.</p>
                  <p>If a man hath broken his bones, will he not be very earneſt to have them ſet again? Sin is the breaking of the bones, and pardon is their ſetting. How doth <hi>David</hi> cry to the Lord (Pſal. 51. 8.) <hi>That the bones which he had broken might rejoyce;</hi> Sin had broken his bones firſt, and the hiding of Gods favour from him, was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond breaking.</p>
                  <p>If a mans peace, or the peace of a Nation be diſturbed, is there not earneſt crying (as at this day) to have it repaires and re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed?
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:40455:360"/> Sin troubles our peace, the peace of the ſoul, and the peace of Kingdomes, <hi>Sin is the great make-bate,</hi> and pardon is the returning of our peace, and quieteth all again, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marvel, if we cry out, <hi>Why doeſt thou not pardon our ſinnes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that is greatly in debt, and fears every hour to be arreſted and caſt in priſon, is trying all friends to get ſecurity, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Sinning is a running in debt with God, and it brings us under the danger of his arreſt every-moment: forgiveneſs cancels the bond, when the ſin is pardoned, the debt is paid, and the ſoul diſcharged; And therefore no wonder if in this caſe, we hear or make ſtrong cries, <hi>Why doeſt thou not pardon our ſinnes. My ſon</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 6. 4. ſpeaking about ſuretiſhip) <hi>if thou be ſurety for thy friend</hi> (if thou haſt ingaged thy ſelf for another) <hi>Give not ſleep to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye-lids, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-thy ſelf as a Roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</hi> Not to give reſt to the eye, nor ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the eye-lids, notes the hotteſt purſuit and greateſt intention of ſpirit about a buſineſs; Thus buſie <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſes a man to be, who becometh ſurety for another. Then what ſhould we do, who have contracted huge debts our ſelves? How ſhould we in this ſenſe give our eyes no reſt, and our eye-lids no ſlumber, till our ſouls be delivered, as a Roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler; that is, from all the power and challenge, which the Law without us, conſcience within us, Satan purſuing us, and the juſtice of God threatning us, can any way make or have againſt the peace of our ſouls. That's the firſt thing from the manner or form in which <hi>Job</hi> ſues for the pardon of ſin. His ſpirit doth not fall, he grows not flat upon this point, but is as high and earneſt here, for the pardon of ſin, as in any of his requeſts for the eaſe of his pained bodie, or the diſſolution of it.</p>

                     </note> received gifts and ſacrifices, becauſe they were wont to elevate and lift them up. Hence Chriſt the ſubſtance of all the Sacrifices, is ſaid to be lifted up, himſelf ſaith, <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the wilderneſs, ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifted up,</hi> (Joh. 3. 14.) we may ſay, as <hi>Aaron</hi> lifted up the Sacrifices at the altar, ſo the Son of man was lifted up. This lifting up, noted alſo the acceptance of thoſe Sacrifices, and the favour of God to thoſe who brought them. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> beſtowed a great favour upon his chief Butler, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 30. according to his dream, he lifted up his head: <hi>Ioſeph</hi> expounded ſo, <hi>After three daies Pharaoh ſhal lift thine head;</hi> that is, <hi>he ſhall freely pardon thy offence,</hi> and beſtow ſome great honour, gift or reward upon thee. And in this ſence it is proper to the text, when ſin is pardoned, a mans head is lifted up himſelf is advanced indeed.</p>
                  <p>The Lord proclaimes his name in this tenor, (Exod. 34. 7.) <hi>The Lord, the Lord, forgiving</hi> (or lifting up) <hi>iniquity;</hi> and Pſal. 32. 1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven</hi> or lifted up.</p>
                  <p>Further, this word ſignifies, not only, to take or lift off a burthen from another, and lay it down: but ſo to lift it off from another, as for a man to take it upon himſelf, and bear it in his ſtead, from whoſe ſhoulders it was taken. And in this ſtrict ſence, we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to underſtand it in the point of pardon; for pardon is not the taking away of ſin from a man, and laying it, none knows where: but ſin being taken off from man, ſome other ſhoulders are prepared to bear it, even the ſhoulders of our Lord Chriſt, on him our ſin is laid, <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53. 6. when the burthen of dept was taken off from us it was charged on Chriſt. He did not take or lift the burthen of ſin from us, and throw it by, but he bare it himſelf; nothing but this could compleate the work of pardon: therfore it was alſo prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 4. <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs and carried our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> And (1 Pet. 2. 22.) <hi>who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his body on</hi>

                     <hi>the tree;</hi> that is, in his humanity or humane nature, while he dwelt with us in the body. Body is not here oppoſed to Soul, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it; as ſometime the whole work is laid upon the ſoul of Chriſt, not excluding his body, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin.</hi> By the whole man this offering was made, and the whole man bare our ſins on the tree. That paſſage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 17. (where the firſt prophecie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is quoted, is very emphatical) when Chriſt had heal'd many of their outward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, this reaſon is added, <hi>That it might be fufilled, which is written</hi> (ſc. Iſa. 53. 9.) <hi>himſelf took our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes.</hi> Now Chriſt took our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes, when he took and bare our ſins: when he took ſin, he took that which was the neceſſary fruit of ſin, our ſickneſſes and our ſorrows; For as in Scripture Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>be made ſin for us;</hi> that is, with the ſin he bare thoſe affiictions and ſorrows, which are the conſequents of ſin; ſo here, when it is ſaid, <hi>He bare our ſorrows and our ſickneſſes,</hi> it takes in the bearing of thoſe ſins, which procured and produced thoſe ſorrows.</p>

So that this word alſo (take it ſtrictly) implies more than a bare act of ſin, ariſing from infirmity, weakneſs or inanimad vertency; it rather notes thoſe ſins which are committed from a crooked purpoſe, from an ill or falſe bent of the heart: when the mind ſees that which is right and good, juſt and ſtraite, and yet turns to crooked paths, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that which is perverſe and worſe.</p>
                  <p>Take one thing further. This word in Scripture, ſignifies not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the act of ſuch ſins; but ſecondly the puniſhment of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 10. Gen. 19. 15. And thirdly, it is put for the means of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or pardon, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>They eat up the ſin of my people, and they</hi>

                     <hi>ſet their heart on their iniquity.</hi> But how did the Prieſts eat up the ſin, and ſet their hearts on the iniquity of the people? Sin can make us but a hungry banquet. The text bears variety of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But to the point in hand, ſin is here put for the ſacrifices of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up for ſin, out of divers of which, the Prieſts had a portion for themſelves to eat; ſo that the Prophet here deſcribes the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible prophaneneſs of thoſe degenerate Prieſts, who ſet their hearts upon the ſacrifices, becauſe themſelves were fed by them, not becauſe the people came to ſeek the favour of God, and make their peace by them, when they had ſinned. As Phyſitians may be ſaid to eat the diſeaſes of the people, and ſet their hearts upon their ſickneſſes, when they (becauſe their own gain is in it) are pleaſed to hear of ſpreading ſickneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or as Lawyers, eat the contentions and quarrels of the people, when they are glad to hear of Suits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they grow rich by it. So thoſe baſe-ſpirited Prieſts were ſaid to eat the ſins of the People, and ſet their hearts on their iniquities, becauſe they were glad to have of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſacrifices, their proviſions being inlarg'd by them. So that then, iniquity is the ſacrifice for iniquity, in which ſenſe alſo Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be made ſin for us,</hi> namely, a ſacrifice for ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                  <p>From the words thus opened, we may obſerve;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to whom <hi>Job</hi> addreſſeth himſelf for pardon: is it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? <hi>And why doeſt not thou pardon my tranſgreſſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God onely can, pardon ſin.</hi> Pardon is his act, his proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar act, he can do it, and none can, but he. We read it among his royal Titles <hi>(Exod.</hi> 34. 7.) the Name of God is proclaimed in this ſtile, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, mercifull and gratious, long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abundant in goodneſs and in truth, keeping mercy for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion an ſin.</hi> Pardoning ſin, is put the laſt of thoſe ſeven attributes, in which the Lord manifeſted himſelf to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as being that, wherein all the former are ſumm'd up, and into which they conveigh their ſeveral bleſſings, to make man compleatly bleſſed; or to ſhew that none can be a pardoner of ſin, but he who is veſted with all thoſe foregoing glorious titles, and therefore none, but God alone. Hence the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> (chap. 7. ver. 18.) puts the queſtion, and challenges all the world; <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning iniquity?</hi> Shew me one if you can, there is no ſin-pardoning God beſides thee. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning?</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, ſome will be, or have been offering at this work, but they all have been,
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:40455:364"/> or will be found meere bunglers at this work. None can pardon as thou doſt. None can pardon, 1. So freely. 2. None ſo fully, 3. None ſo continually, 4. None eternally, 5. None ſo indifferently, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of ſinners or ſins, as thou doeſt. It is all one to thee, what the ſins are, and all one to thee, whoſe the ſins are, ſo they come to ask thy pardon. And that which is a diſadvantage to ask pardon of man, is an encouragement to ask it of God, the greatneſs of our ſins. The Pſalmiſt did, and any man may make that his plea, <hi>Lord pardon my ſin, for it is great.</hi> Dare any be a competitor with God in this work? The Phariſees put the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion right, if they had not miſtook the perſon to whom they put it, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Who is this that forgiveth ſins? none can forgive ſin but God alone.</hi> Again ſin (in one ſenſe) is committed onely againſt God, and for that reaſon alſo, God onely is the pardoner of it: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Againſt thee onely have I ſinned.</hi> Onely the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor can remit the debt, and he the offence, to whom we have done the wrong. God is wron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d in all ſins chiefly, and the wrong is ſo much his, that it may well be called only his, therefore without him no pardon.</p>
                  <p>But man is charged to forgive his brother: <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 4. <hi>Forgive thy brother ſeven times;</hi> and Chriſt hath taught us to pray <hi>for the forgiveneſs of our treſpaſſes, as we forgive thoſe that treſpaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us,</hi> Mat. 6. 12.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, there are two things in all ſecond-able ſins; Firſt, diſobedience againſt God; Secondly injury to man; That which man can, or is required to forgive, and be a pardoner of, is only the injury done unto himſelf, ſo as not to revenge it; he cannot take off the ſin againſt God, or ſtay him from taking vengeance.</p>
                  <p>But other Scriptures ſpeak of a power committed to man, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and forgive ſin, <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit are remitted, and whoſeſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, This power is not authoritative and magiſterial, but miniſterial and declarative. God hath ſet up ſuch an inſtitution, that man ſhould pardon man, becauſe many men, yea moſt men are not competent judges of their own eſtates, whether they be fit for pardon or no: Many wicked men, would remit and looſen themſelves when as their ſins are to be retained; they ſee not their ſins, as another man may and doth ſee them: The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> could ſay to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8. 23. <hi>I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity; Simon</hi>
                     <pb n="715" facs="tcp:40455:364" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                     <hi>Magus</hi> did not perceive it, he did not know his own condition, he flatter'd himſelf, and thought all well, becauſe lately ſprinckled with the water of Baptiſme; therefore ſome muſt declare theſe men bound, and hold them ſtill under ſin.</p>
                  <p>Again, There are others, whoſe hearts are upright and ſincere, ſuch as are indeed reconciled to God, and all whoſe ſins are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but they are not able to make it out, and they cannot clear up this thing from the word to their own hearts: therefore they need a helper, to declare them pardoned, for they cannot ſpeak or declare it to their own ſouls: in ſuch caſes, both for the conviction of preſuming ſinners, and the help of upright-hearted, yet weak and doubting Chriſtians, God hath left this power with his Miniſters, <hi>whoſe ſins ye remit they are remitted, and whoſe ſins ye retain are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi> As in the caſe of leproſie, <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. The Leper was brought to the Prieſt, and ſet before him as a Judge in that point; many were not competent Judges of their own diſeaſes, they could not reſolve it, whether they had the leproſie or no; ſome perceiving a ſcab or a ſore riſing upon them, thought (preſently) it was the leproſie, when indeed, it was not, and ſo wronged themſelves; Others who were indeed infected, would not be perſwaded that they were, therefore the Prieſts office was, to determine theſe caſes, to bind and reſtrain, to looſen and let them go, as he ſaw cauſe: In which ceremonial practice, we have the ſhadow of this Goſpel practiſe, in the power of remitting or retaining, of binding or of looſing ſin, according to the various conditions of men. Yet all this while God keepeth the great work in his own hand, he is <hi>the pardoner,</hi> and therefore <hi>Job</hi> (as the whole tenour of the Scripture rules it) made his addreſs to him, <hi>why doeſt not thou pardon my tranſgreſſion, and take away mine iniquity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, From theſe expreſſions about the pardon of ſin, we may learn what the pardon of ſin is; <hi>Pardon of ſin, is the removing or the lifting off, the paſſing away of ſin from the ſinner;</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is pardon of ſin. Scripture language is very various and copious about this thing, and yet all runs into this general; I ſhall inſtance ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Pardon is often expreſſed by a Metaphor from paying of a debt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>I write unto you little Children, becauſe</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>your ſins are forgiven you;</hi> the word notes, your ſins are paid, your debts are ſatisfied; the ſame word the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. in reference to the ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>God spared not</hi>
                     <pb n="716" facs="tcp:40455:365"/> 
                     <hi>his Sonne;</hi> He did not ſpare him the debt, that is, he neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave the whole, nor compounded with him to take half, or a part, and remit the reſt; no, he made him pay all fully down. So, to be pardoned, notes the ſparing of the debt, letting the debt paſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling us to account about it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Pardon of ſin, is the remooving it out of ſight <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 38. 17.) <hi>Thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy back,</hi> ſaith <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> that is, thou haſt put them out of thy ſight. As when man is ſaid, <hi>to caſt the Word of God behind him,</hi> Pſal. 50. 17. <hi>or behind his back,</hi> Neh. 9. 26. The meaning is, he regards it not, at all to obey it; ſo when God caſts the ſin of man behind his back, the meaning is, he will not regard or ſee it all, to puniſh it. That phraſe uſed by the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> is of the ſame importance, though of a deeper ſence, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the ſea.</hi> Who can live thither to fetch them up? But, may they not riſe up or ſwim, out of themſelvs? Surely no; our ſins are not cork or wood, but they are iron or lead, they are like ſtone, or like a mil-ſtone. To ſhew how irrecoverably the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were deſtroyed in the red-Sea, it is ſaid, they <hi>ſank like lead in thoſe mighty waters (Exod.</hi> 15 10.) and to ſhew how irrecoverably <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, the holy Ghoſt ſaith, that, <hi>Babylon ſhall be like a great mil-ſtone caſt into the Sea by a mighty Angel</hi> (Rev. 18. 21.)

                  <p>There are three things in ſin; The inward matter, the foul evil, the ſtock, the root of ſin, which is natural corruption dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us, and flowing out by actions. Secondly, The defilement and pollution of ſin: Thirdly, The guilt; when we ſay ſin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned or taken away, it is not in the former (though in pardoned perſons corruption is mortified, and the actings of it abated) but in the latter, the guilt is taken away, which is the Obligation to puniſhment, and ſo the puniſhment is taken away too; nothing vindictive or ſatisfactory to the juſtice of God, ſhall ever be laid upon that ſoul, whoſe ſin is pardoned: Hence <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 24. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet fore-ſhewing, how happy a pardoned people ſhall be, aſſures them; <hi>The inhabitant ſhall n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Plague, and ſword, and famine, and death, all theſe evils go away, when ſin goes; Judgments are nothing elſe but unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſins; ſin unpardoned, is the root which giveth ſap and life to all the Troubles which are upon man or Nation: And as ſin committed, is every judgment radically, that is, there is a fitneſs in ſin to produce and bring forth any evil upon man; ſo pardon of ſin is every Mercy radically; when you have pardon, from thence every other particular Mercy ſprings; you may cut out any bleſſing, any comfort out of the pardon of ſin; particular Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are but pardon of ſin ſpecificated or individuated, brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this or that particular Mercy; of all bleſſings you may ſay, <hi>this is pardon of ſin, that's pardon of ſin, and t'other is pardon of ſin.</hi> Forgiveneſs deſtroyeth that wherein the ſtrength of ſin lies, it
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:40455:366"/> deſtroyeth our guilt, and to us aboliſheth the condemning power of the Law: in theſe the ſtrength of ſin lies. Hence when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had committed that great ſin in making the golden Calf, the firſt thing <hi>Moſes</hi> did, was, to pray for the pardon of ſin, and he did it with a ſtrange kind of <hi>Rhetoricke,</hi> Exod. 32. 32. <hi>Oh, this people have ſinned a great ſin, and have made them gods of Gold. And now if thou wilt forgive their ſin;</hi> what then <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi> There's no more ſaid; <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſilent in the reſt, it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſpeech: a pauſe made by holy paſſion, not the fulneſs of the Sentence. Such are often uſed in Scripture, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>And if it bear fruit,</hi> what then? Our own thoughts are left to ſupply the event: Our tranſlaters add, <hi>well.</hi> The Greek tranſlators ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that in <hi>Exodus,</hi> thus; <hi>If thou wilt forgive them their ſin, forgive them:</hi> We may ſupply it with the word in <hi>Luke, If thou wilt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, well.</hi> As if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, Lord forgive them, and then though they have done <hi>very ill,</hi> yet, I know it will be <hi>very well</hi> with them; God cannot with-hold any mercy, where he hath granted pardon, for that with the antecedents and requiſites of it, is every mercy. <hi>Moſes</hi> knew what would follow well enough if they were pardoned, and what if they were not: therefore he adds; <hi>And if not, blot me I pray thee out of thy book which thou haſt written:</hi> If their ſins muſt ſtand upon record, <hi>Moſes</hi> would not; he knew, if they were an unpardoned people, they were an undone people, all miſeries would quickly break in upon, yea, overwhelm them, and he deſired not to out-live the proſperity of that people. If <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt bear their ſins, they muſt alſo bear the wrath of God, and if their ſin be but taken off, then his love is ſettled on them: <hi>God gives quailes ſometime, but he never gives pardons in anger.</hi> Fourthly obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The greateſt ſins fall within the compaſs of Gods pardoning mercy.</hi> The words in the text are of the higheſt ſignification. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks not in a diminutive language, he is willing to lay load upon himſelf; they whoſe hearts are upright will not ſtand min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the matter, and ſay they have ſins, but theirs are ſmall ones, ſins not grown to the ſtature of other mens. As the ſins of a godly man, may be very great ſins, ſo (when they are) he acknowledges that they are. I know not where to ſet the bounds, in regard of the nature or quantity of ſin; what ſin is there w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> a wicked man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, but a godly man (poſſibly) may commit it, excepting that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>holy Ghoſt?</hi> Theſe <hi>Job</hi> did, and the Saints may put to God
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:40455:366"/> in confeſſion: and as he did not, ſo they need not be diſcouraged to ask pardon for them, becauſe they are great. <hi>The grace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is as large as any evil of ſin, the Law can charge us with.</hi> The grace of the Goſpel is as large as the curſe of the Law; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Law can call or ſhew to be a ſin, the Goſpel can ſhew a pardon for it; whatever the Law can bind us with, the Goſpel can unlooſe. <hi>The Mercy-ſeat covered the whole Ark;</hi> The Mercy-ſeat noted the forgiveneſs of ſin; and if you read the deſcription of it <hi>(Exod.</hi> 25.) you ſhall find that it was exactly, to a hairs breadth, of the ſame dimenſions with the Ark, wherein the Law was put: intimating, that there was mercy and pardon for ſin, let it come out of any part of the Law laid up in that Ark. <hi>As the leaſt ſins muſt of neceſſity have a pardon, ſo the greateſt ſins are in a poſſibility of pardon:</hi> And the truth is, there is no ſin, as it is an <hi>Anomy,</hi> a tranſgreſſion of the Law, without the compaſs of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. It is not the malignity of the ſin, but the malignity of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that makes it incurable; the ſin againſt the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> is not unpardonable, becauſe there wants mercy large enough to pardon it, but becauſe it refuſeth the mercy which ſhould pardon it, and the medicine that ſhould heal it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Obſerve, who it is that here preſſeth thus for pardon; it is <hi>Job,</hi> and was <hi>Job</hi> never pardoned till now? Or was this, (think you) the firſt time that ever <hi>Job</hi> prayed for pardon? Had not <hi>Job</hi> thought of this buſineſs before? Without queſtion he had; he was one of whom God gave this teſtimony, that he was <hi>a juſt and an upright man, one that feared God and eſchewed evil;</hi> He that did all this, and was all this, muſt firſt be in favour with God, and yet <hi>Job</hi> cryeth out, <hi>Why doſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſſion?</hi> Whence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They whoſe ſins are pardoned, muſt yet pray for the pardon of ſin: Yea, they who, upon good grounds, have aſſurance, that their ſins are pardoned, muſt yet pray for the pardon of their ſins,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 13. When <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David, God hath put away thy ſin;</hi> he aſſured him that he was pardoned, and doubtleſs the heart of <hi>David</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith to let in that gracious Meſſage; he was not faithleſs, but believing. Yet <hi>David</hi> in his penitential <hi>Pſalm</hi> penned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, prayes, (O how earneſtly!) for pardon, again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? That which a man is aſſured he hath, he may pray to have and enjoy: make it ſo high, which ſome make the grand objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt this point. Why ſhould we pray (ſay they) for that
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:40455:367"/> which we have already: I ſay, a man may pray for that, which he hath already, and is aſſured he hath. Chriſt himſelf was aſſured of the love of his Father, and that his Father would ſtick to him for ever, and he knew God was neer unto him, yet he cries <hi>(Mat.</hi> 27. 46.) <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Which Queſtion may be reſolved into this Petition, <hi>My God, my God, do not forſake me.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> had received a Meſſage by the Prophet concerning a great temporal Mercy, the eſtabliſhing of his houſe, that, God would ſettle him and his Poſterity in the Throne for ever; the text ſaith (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 15.) he preſently went in, and ſate before the Lord, and there makes a moſt earneſt Prayer; and what is it about? He prayeth that God would ſettle and eſtabliſh his Kingdom, verſ. 25, 26. <hi>And now, O Lord God, the thing which thou haſt spoken concerning thy Servant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his houſe, eſtabliſh it for ever, and do as thou haſt ſaid, &amp;c. and let the houſe of thy Servant David be eſtabliſhed before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Might not the Lord anſwer (according to this Objection) why doeſt thou trouble me about this? Did not I ſend thee a Meſſage even now, that I would eſtabliſh thy Kingdom? Doſt thou think I have forgotten my Promiſe, or will be unfaithful to it? We find not <hi>David</hi> thus chidden for praying thus. Nay at <hi>v.</hi> 27. you ſhall ſee how <hi>David</hi> makes this the very ground of his prayer, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou haſt revealed to thy ſervant, ſaying, I will build thee an houſe, therefore hath thy ſervant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> Even becauſe thou haſt revealed this unto me, that thou wilt build me an houſe, therefore upon this very ground I make this prayer, that thou wouldeſt build it. And to ſhew, that he was full of Faith, the thing ſhould be done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prayed it might be done, he adds, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>Thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou haſt promiſed this goodneſs unto thy ſervant. Now therefore let it pleaſe thee, to bleſs the houſe of thy ſervant.</hi> No man could be fuller of Aſſurance, or fuller of Prayer than <hi>David</hi> was. Likewiſe Chriſt knew and was aſſured, that his ſheepe, his elect people, ſhould continue for ever, and that none ſhould be able to take them out of his hand, yet how abundantly doth he pour forth his Spirit in prayer about theſe things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. Again, Chriſt was aſſured he ſhould be delivered and upheld in death, Yet <hi>in the daies of his fleſh he offered up prayers and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations with ſtrong cries and tears to him that was able to ſave</hi>
                     <pb n="721" facs="tcp:40455:367"/> 
                     <hi>him from death, and he was heard in what he feared,</hi> Heb. 5. 7. He was not afraid of the event, whether he ſhould hold out and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail or no, whether he ſhould conquer and obtain the victory or no, he doubted not the ſucceſs of this war, though it were with <hi>principalities and powers;</hi> His fear was only a natural paſſion, which he took upon him, when he took our nature upon him. He was certain of the iſſue, and knew he ſhould carry the work through a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the armies of hell, he would never have undertaken it elſe: yet he prayeth with ſtrong cries, that he might be ſtrengthened. So then, it is no argument, becauſe a Believer knoweth his ſin is pardoned, that therefore he ſhould not pray for pardon; for many things, of which there was clear and certain evidence, that they were, or ſhould be, have been prayed about; it is our duty, for it hath been the practiſe, both of Chriſt, and of his people to pray in ſuch a ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Further we may Anſwer: Matters of Faith are of Two ſorts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as are fully accompliſhed, acted and compleated in all the parts and circumſtances of them: for, and about ſuch things, we are not to pray. No man is to pray for the Redemption of the World, for that is a thing paſt, and yet it is a matter of Faith: But the pardon of ſin, though it be compleat in it ſelf, and a matter of Faith to us, yet it is compleating and perfecting every day more and more. Pardon is given us, yet we feel not all, which pardon gives. It is a ſetled act on Gods part, yet it is in motion on ours; that is, in a perfective motion. Therefore, though we are aſſured that our ſins are pardoned, and ſhall ſtand pardoned for ever, yet we may pray about the pardon of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe a man know his ſins are pardoned, yet he may pray to know it more, and that his evidences may be made yet clearer to him; for though ſin cannot be more pardoned in reſpect of God at one time, than at another; yet in regard of man it may. He apprehends the pardon of his ſin more now, than before, and may hereafter apprehend it more, than now: And it is worth the while to beſtow pains in prayer for pardon, to have the pardon a little more inlightned: The degrees of any grace or favour, as well as the matter and ſubſtance of them, are worthy all our ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and moſt ſerious enquiries at the throne of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He that hath aſſurance of the pardon of ſin, is to pray for the pardon of ſin, becauſe he continueth ſtill to ſin: And though
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:40455:368"/> it be a truth, that ſin uncommitted is pardoned in the decree and purpoſe of God, yet we muſt not walk by the decrees of God, but by his commandements and rules. His decree pardons ſin from all eternity; but his rule is, that we ſhould pray for pardon every day, as we pray for the bread we eat every day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 11, 12. We muſt not ſay, God hath pardoned all ſin at once, therefore no matter to ask it again: or I have once had the ſight of pardon, and therefore the ſight of ſin, ſhall never trouble me; ſeeing we are directed to ſearch our hearts for ſin, and to ſeek to God for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don continually. So long as we ſin it becomes us to be ſuitors for the pardon of ſin. He that hath ceaſed to ſin, may ceaſe to ask the forgiveneſs of ſin, till then, I know neither rule nor promiſe, that gives a diſpenſation for this duty.</p>
                  <p>To cloſe this point, there are two Caſes wherein believers are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to renew their ſuits about the pardon of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, (which though it be lamentable, yet it is poſſible) in the caſe of falling into ſcandalous and groſs ſins: Theſe not only weaken aſſurance, and be-night the ſoul, but exceedingly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, and grieve the holy Ghoſt. This cauſed <hi>David</hi> to pray and cry for the pardon and purging of his ſin, as freſhly and as ſtrongly, as if he had never received a pardon, or any evidence of Gods love (of which yet he had great ſtore) before that day, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In times of great troubles and trials, whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal or National, the Saints re-inforce prayer about pardon: This was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, his perſonal afflictions occaſion'd him to begg the remiſſion of ſins; and not only remiſſion for ſins, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but for all the ſins, he had committed either before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Converſion. Even our formerly pardon'd ſins, need pardon, when we looſe the ſight of pardon, and when the ſoul hath no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but viſions of terrour, it muſt ſeek viſions of peace, in the free-grace of God, renewing and ſealing pardon in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having thus breathed his ſpirit in arguings, complaints, and prayers, moves the Lord, for a ſpeedy end and gracious anſwer: otherwiſe he ſees no way, but he muſt breath back his ſpirit into the hands of the Lord who gave it, and lay his body in the duſt, from whence it was taken.</p>

                  <p>Thus (through the ſtrength of Chriſt) ſome diſcoveries have been made about this firſt congreſſe, or charge between <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and <hi>Job.</hi> But <hi>Job</hi> hath not yet done; Behold a ſecond and a third Combatant, ready to enter the liſt againſt him; And when theſe three have once tryed their skill and ſtrength upon him, they all three charge him a freſh, a ſecond time, and two of them, a third: <hi>Was ever poor ſoul held ſo hard to it, as he!</hi> How much doth the life of grace make him exceed man, when he (as a man) could ſcarce be reckon'd among the living? Truth and grace will triumpth and prevail, notwithſtanding all the diſadvantages of fleſh &amp; nature. Is it not ſtrange, that a man ſhould not be weary
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:40455:369"/> with arguing, while he often profeſſes he was wearied with living? That while he could ſcarce fetch his breath for pain, he ſhould do ſo much work (in a manner) without a breathing. For, as the Meſſengers of his troubles gave him no reſt; <hi>But while one was yet ſpeaking, there came another alſo and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And while a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was yet ſpeaking, a third came and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. So neither did theſe diſputants about his troubles. While <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were yet ſpeaking, <hi>Bildad anſwered and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. While <hi>Bildad</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were yet ſpeaking, <hi>Zophar anſwered and ſaid.</hi> What <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaz</hi> ſaid, and <hi>Job</hi> anſwered in this firſt undertaking, you have heard: The opening of what <hi>Bildad</hi> had to ſay, and <hi>Job</hi> to anſwer, waits (till the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe it) a further opportunity. What is now (as himſelf hath pleaſed to enable his unworthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument) offered, waits upon him for his bleſſing. To him all bleſſing is for ever due; on him let praiſes ever waite, for all his bleſſings. <hi>Amen.</hi>
